In 2005, the Japanese government introduced the Basic Law of Shokuiku (food and nutrition education) to promote national food self-sufficiency, improve public health, and preserve local culinary culture through domestic food consumption. This paper argues that the campaign attempts to advance both governmental and public interests in food sovereignty by constructing common images of Japanese diets and nostalgia for rural agriculture; along the way it attempts to increase a sense of solidarity between urban consumers and rural producers. Nevertheless, the campaign focuses on consumer's food literacy, thus framing food sovereignty as responsibilities of people, and diverts public attention from structural issues embedded within the nation's food system, including national dependence on other countries for food security, as well as the marginal economic status of rural agriculture. Simultaneously, the feeling of nostalgia for rural agriculture remains, expanding an imaginary of food sovereignty among some urban consumers. Drawing on an investigation of policy discourses and in-depth interviews with young adult consumers in urban Japan, this paper examines how the notion of food sovereignty and Japanese diets have been constructed and advanced through the nationwide Shokuiku campaign. The decade-long campaign has evolved to become an agent of social control of urban consumer food consumption rather than helping consumers to play a role in establishing a system underpinned by food sovereignty as an alternative to the industrial present."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true}",>true,4,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developed,Asia and Pacific

Specifically, it explores the class-differentiated implications of food sovereignty in a zone of ecological crisis - Bangladesh's coastal Khulna district. Much land in this deltaic zone that had previously been employed for various forms of peasant production has been transformed by the introduction of brackish-water shrimp aquaculture. This has, in turn, caused massive depeasantization and ecological crisis throughout the region. Through an examination of two markedly different polders (embanked islands) - one which has been overrun by shrimp production and one that has resisted it - we ask how coastal communities and their members have variously negotiated their rapidly changing ecologies and food systems based on their relative class position and access to land. We highlight the multiple meanings that peasants from different classes ascribe not just to shrimp, but also to broader questions of adaptation, community and life in uncertain terrains. We show that while food sovereignty in non-shrimp areas has averted the depeasantization affecting shrimp areas, it has not necessarily led to greater equality in agrarian class relations. To achieve such ends, we suggest that a broader conception of agrarian sovereignty provides a critical and necessary corollary to self-determination in agricultural production."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,Asia and Pacific

The authors bring this practice to light, and demonstrate the value of food production and consumption systems that are localized rather than globalized. Based on extensive field research in India and Bangladesh, with and by farming communities, the book offers both people-based and evidence-based perspectives on the value of ecological farming, the survival strategies of the very poor, and the ongoing contribution of biodiversity to livelihoods. It also introduces new concepts such as ""the social landscape"" and ""the ethical relations underlying production systems"" relevant to key debates concerning the cultural politics of food sovereignty, land tenure, and the economics of food systems. Photographs of plants, crops and people, especially of women and children, showing their relationships with their environs, the seeds they preserve, the foods they gather and cook, and the recipes they exchange, are included.

This approach emphasizes small-scale farmers as the main actors in a food and agricultural system. It encourages small-scale farmers to fully participate in the decision-making process of national and/or international agreements regarding food and agriculture systems in order to benefit and empower them. Food sovereignty aspires to return the food and agriculture system to a domestic level, which gives freedom to small-scale farmers to produce foods reflecting their knowledge and experience and suited to the local conditions. Agroecology is a management approach aimed at achieving a sustainable agricultural ecosystem utilizing local resources, local wisdom, and local farmers' knowledge in producing foods. Thus, agroecology minimizes production costs, increases the quality and quantity of foods, and gives small-scale farmers more benefits. According to knowledge-sharing, an educational theory for explaining farmer-to-farmer ways of learning, there are three requirements for an effective learning process: (1) a public space to share knowledge and experience; (2) provision of opportunities for every participant to share and exchange their knowledge, views, and experience; and (3) a need for farmers to enhance their competence. The agroecological approach has been practiced and disseminated within farmers' communities at the grassroots level and has shown promising results. Studies showed that by practicing agroecology farmers produced more foods and gained other benefits, suggesting that agroecology could be one answer for the food crisis. Farmers' knowledge and experience are vital to food and agriculture policy-making. Thus, by recognizing farmers' knowledge and understanding their learning processes, a fair participatory food and agricultural system can be achieved, an ideal that the food sovereignty approach strives for.

Subsistence agriculture, which is forest based, constitutes the main source of rural food and livelihoods. However, due to constraints of terrain and climate, agricultural productivity is low, resulting in large food deficits and leading to a considerable proportion of the adult male population migrating from the region in search of employment and livelihoods. Remittances from the migrants and local off-farm employment contribute to community purchasing power which may be used to buy food from the open market and government controlled Public Distribution System (PDS). Depletion of natural resources, changing climatic conditions, the recent economic recession and sharply fluctuating food prices have not only decreased local food production but also reduced employment opportunities locally as well as outside the area, rendering the entire region highly vulnerable to food insecurity. This study, which was carried out in the Upper Kosi Catchment in Kumaon Himalaya, India, revealed that not only has annual agricultural productivity declined by nearly 125 Kg per ha (25 %) during the last 30 years, causing an annual food deficit of 1883 tonnes (65 %) and massive decline in per capita food production, but that local off-farm employment opportunities in different traditional rural sectors has also declined. Furthermore, the recent economic recession and the resultant job losses for migrants has decreased incoming remittances by 20 %-25 %, causing the loss of local purchasing power and posing a serious threat to food security. Those particularly affected are marginal and smallholder farmers, and landless households, which mainly include socially backward communities and families with very low incomes. It is therefore imperative that a community oriented framework for the management of land, water and forest resources is planned and implemented in this region, together with the generation of viable means of off-farm employment at the local level."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,Asia and Pacific

We employed a two-step model for strengthening food security using a range of participatory activities to first understand and characterize, and secondly strengthen informal seed systems in the target regions. We documented seed pathways, histories, and storage as well as gender roles in each community. Informal seed systems were strengthened through identifying potential species for commercialization, addressing technological barriers to seed analysis, and conducting seed fairs and seed banking. These activities not only strengthened informal seed systems, but also significantly enhanced all four pillars of food security in the study communities. Recommendations for future informal seed systems and food security research include extending research into more communities and countries, focusing on the potential for enhancing formal seed systems, and examining the possibilities for synergies with food sovereignty approaches."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>true, ""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,3,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,Asia and Pacific

This paper analyses this ongoing process of agrarian development from the perspective of three major approaches: the food availability approach, the entitlement and livelihood approach, and food sovereignty. We draw on quantitative and qualitative data collected from 68 households in rural Tamil Nadu on landholding and management, farm diversity, agricultural production, food availability, off-farm employment, rural out-migration, objective and subjective wellbeing, and socioeconomic and demographic profile of respondents. Results: Rural households were classified in four categories, based on their engagement in agriculture and off-farm employment, to understand the interplay between food sufficiency and wellbeing. The households solely based on small-scale agriculture were found to have higher food sufficiency, landholding, and crop diversity, but lower monthly income and wellbeing. The households that were engaged in off-farm employment in addition to agriculture were found to have lower food sufficiency, landholding, and crop diversity, yet they exhibited better wellbeing and higher income. The landless households, which were primarily engaged in off-farm labour, work in distant markets had higher income than households solely engaged in farming.

The findings indicated that the impacts of women's participation in local or distant employment schemes on household food security and wellbeing were complex and shaped by the household's engagement in agriculture and their aspirations for a better quality of life. Conclusions: None of the three food security approaches provides a fully satisfactory basis for interventions aimed at enhancing the capacity of small and marginal farmers to achieve food security and meet their aspirations for wellbeing in the research area, although the entitlements and livelihoods approach has had a significant impact on local possibilities for livelihoods diversification. The study demonstrates that the interaction between food security and the subjective wellbeing of farmers is complex and shaped by the productivity of small-scale agriculture and livelihood aspirations of farm households."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""annelie.bernhart""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,Asia and Pacific

The purpose of this study was to investigate principal's perceptions on barriers  to healthy dietary choice among pupils within a socio-ecological framework. Focus groups (n = 11) were carried out with school principals and staff (n = 55) in two rural districts of Sri Lanka. Principals identified a number of barriers to healthy dietary choice by students, which could be found at a number of levels of influence of a socio-ecological framework: (i) structural level barriers included educational and agricultural policies, (ii) living and working level barriers included employment opportunities and local food production, (iii) social and community level barriers included traditions and social/cultural beliefs and (iv) individual level barriers included knowledge and preference. Findings from this study suggest that the barriers to healthy dietary choice amongst secondary school students in Sri Lanka occur at many levels supporting the use of multifactorial programmes to promote healthy eating.

We identify three complementary processes through which loss of food production may escalate enduring conflicts: lowered opportunity costs of rebelling, increased opportunities for recruitment, and accentuated and more widespread social grievances. Using India as a test case, we investigate how year-on-year fluctuations in food production affect the severity of ongoing armed conflicts. The statistical analysis shows that harvest loss is robustly associated with increased levels of political violence.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of 4080 households conducted in 2012. Data collected included: child and maternal anthropometric measurements; child age and sex; maternal age, education, occupation and empowerment in agriculture; and household size, number of children, religion, caste and agro-ecological zone. Associations between the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI)'s Five Domains of Empowerment (5DE) sub-index and its ten component indicators and child length-for-age Z-scores (LAZ) and weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ) were estimated, using ordinary least-squares regression models, with and without adjustments for key child, maternal and household level covariates. SETTING: Two  hundred and forty rural communities across sixteen districts of Nepal. SUBJECTS:  Children under 24 months of age and their mothers (n 1787). RESULTS: The overall  WEAI 5DE was positively associated with LAZ (beta=0.20, P=0.04). Three component  indicators were also positively associated with LAZ: satisfaction with leisure time (beta=0.27, P<0.01), access to and decisions regarding credit (beta=0.20, P=0.02) and autonomy in production (beta=0.10, P=0.04). No indicator of women's empowerment in agriculture was associated with WLZ. CONCLUSIONS: Women's empowerment in agriculture, as measured by the WEAI 5DE and three of its ten component indicators, was significantly associated with LAZ, highlighting the potential role of women's empowerment in improving child nutrition in Nepal. Additional studies are needed to determine whether interventions to improve women's empowerment will improve child nutrition."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,Asia and Pacific

The policy response to tackling malnutrition shows an overwhelmingly technocratic bias, which depoliticizes the broader question of how the agro-food regime is structured. Taking an agrarian and human rights-based approach, this paper argues that rural malnutrition must be analyzed as symptomatic of a deepening agrarian crisis in which the obsession with productivity increases and commercialization overrides people's democratic right to culturally appropriate, good, nutritious food. Using qualitative insights from a case study of three villages, this research illustrates how agricultural modernization and commercialization reproduce rural malnutrition by degrading local biodiversity and the rural poor's access to nutrient-rich diets. In so doing, it undermines the official discourse's simplistic and literal reading of malnutrition as a pathological health condition resulting from the mere absence of certain micronutrients in the human body, and thus questions the adequacy of the proposed solutions. Instead, this research suggests that solving malnutrition in large part involves facilitating the rural poor's access to nutritious diets through democratizing and reorganizing the agriculture sector in a manner that is eco-friendly and unconstrained by market imperatives. It cautiously advances agroecology and food sovereignty as possible alternatives, while recognizing that overcoming the challenges agrarian class conflict, gender disparity and urban-rural divide pose would not be easy.","0

Interpretive content analysis was used to identify salient themes. In discussions, people identified more closely with dietary qualities or patterns than nutrients, and valued a balanced, fresh diet that made them feel 'light'. People possessed basic knowledge of 'good' store foods, and wanted to increase familiarity and experience with foods in packets and cans through practical and social skills, especially cooking. Education about contemporary foods was obtained from key family role models and outside the home  through community-based organisations, including school, rather than pamphlets and flip charts.

Based on Native values, the garden serves the community's needs for healthy, locally produced food.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

In recent years, community organizations are taking a more active role in facilitating foodways transmission. In the Standing Rock Nation of the northern Great Plains, several community organizations, including tribal government agencies, are creating opportunities for elders to share their knowledge about traditional foods. The impetus for these activities comes from elders themselves, who attribute high rates of diet-related diseases to a loss of knowledge about traditional foods. We conducted eighteen semi-structured interviews with elders and organizers in the midst of these activities to reflect on processes of foodways transmission, including the implications of facilitation by community organizations. Interviews were focused on four human ecological concepts: perception and diversity; human ecological relations; context; and practical wisdom.

Moreover, research on the intra-urban variability of home gardens is sparse. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to assess the scale and scope of residential gardens in Portland, Oregon, a metropolitan region renowned for its innovations in sustainability. Using a combination of mapping, spatial regression, and a mail survey, we compare residential UA and the characteristics and motivations of gardeners in two socioeconomically differentiated areas of Portland and one of its major suburbs. Results demonstrate that engagement in UA is differentiated along both spatial and socioeconomic lines, with more educated respondents engaging for environmental reasons and more lowincome respondents relying on their gardens for food security. We contextualize our findings within broader urban processes, e.g. reinvestment in the urban core and displacement of poverty to the periphery. For policymakers, our results suggest the need for sustainability messaging that is sensitive to a variety of motivations and that resonates with a diverse population. For a city to reach a broader population, it may need to reframe its sustainability goals in new ways, while attending to the structural constraints to food access that cannot be resolved through local food production alone.

The ordinance exempts direct transactions of farm food from licensure and inspection in an effort to maintain the viability of small, diversified farms in a struggling rural economy. The ordinance effectively carves out a space of food sovereignty in each town that enacts it, thereby protecting conditions of life and livelihood within local food networks. The analysis focuses on the spatiality of the practices that comprise biopolitics, with attention to the scalar politics in play as well; that is, the ways in which modalities of power shape and are shaped by social, economic, and political scales of organization.

We utilized available high-resolution land-use-and land-cover data to map and empirically compare size, land use, and spatial patterns of sites of current urban agriculture as well as land areas with potential for expanding urban agriculture. By linking current vegetable production data, and potential future urban agriculture land with per capita vegetable consumption data, we were able to estimate the total potential population that could be supported by locally produced vegetables. Our results showed that by scaling up current vegetable production in existing NYC community gardens, potential agricultural productivity on other underutilized or vacant land was 0.26 kg/m(2)/year for NYC. For Osaka, existing rice and dry fields could produce in comparison 0.54 and 0.74 kg/m(2)/year, respectively. By combining potential urban and peri-urban vegetable production measures with estimated needed vegetable caloric intake per person per year, we show that the current vegetable production levels in Osaka can feed approximately 0.50 million people. However, if the region maximizes existing underused speculative dry fields, urban and peri-urban agriculture could feed approximately 3.4 million people per year. In NYC, current vegetable production in community gardens is estimated to feed only 1700 people per year. However, if NYC maximized all available urban vacant lots and other open spaces, potential vegetable production could provide food annually for 0.55 million people. We discuss how though both community gardens in NYC and remaining rice and dry fields in Osaka have been out of formal city planning with clear land-use definition in zoning, these agricultural practices have nonetheless emerged as important sources of local food production and nutrition on the one hand, and sites of social benefit on the other.","<p>Last updated - 2018-09-10</p>

In this paper I draw upon empirical data from the Guatemalan center of agricultural biodiversity to investigate the concern that market expansion will displace peasant agriculture and undermine a cornerstone of the global food supply. I find that even though peasants' livelihoods involve multiple forms of market provisioning, they also engage in a Polanyian 'double movement' to protect their subsistence-oriented agricultural practices from the potentially deleterious effects of markets. I also investigate the so-called 'agrarian question' about the effects of market expansion on the viability of peasant agriculture, finding that although new forms of market provisioning are likely exacerbating rural inequality, the income from market activities actually enables rural Guatemalans to reproduce the conditions for peasant agriculture. Ultimately, I observe that the conservation of agricultural biodiversity and, consequently, global food security are contingent upon the 'food sovereignty' of peasant farmers.","PII 917020061     48

It has also used its oil wealth to support cooperatively-oriented economic activity, without necessarily fundamentally altering the property structure. Thus, the social change-oriented political economy exists alongside the traditional one. Focusing on agrarian transformation, we examine ethnographically how these factors have impacted the state's capacity to attain its goal of national food sovereignty. We find that the state's ability to accomplish this objective has been compromised by lack of agency-level capacity, inter-agency conflict and the persistence of the previously-extant agrarian property structure.

One of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal is that most part of the food is traded through markets handling patterns that are hardly compatible with family farming. Perhaps the key to solving this problem lies in identifying the achievements and paths followed by the same producers that have developed alternative marketing strategies. Many family farmers have developed viable entrepreneurships, building innovative markets for their products based on short circuit commercialization systems that not only increase profitability due to a cut of intermediaries, but also lower the food prices and provides the final consumer with better quality products as a consequence of the added value strategy followed by the producers. In that context, this study exposes three cases of family farms located in the irrigation area of Rio Dulce, Province of Santiago del Estero (Argentina). The cases present a similar productive, economic and social logic, characterized by a strong co-production between man and nature, provided by a combination of endogenous resources, value added, generation of technological novelties and craftsmanship, among others, within a strong process of family labor intensification."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,South America and Caribbean

Cultivation patterns, seed origin, plant use and species diversity were analyzed by means of semi-structured interviews. Inhabitants of this community cultivate vegetable-gardens and a high proportion of dwellers collect seeds from previous harvests, mostly of non-perennial plants.

Plant richness analysis showed that inhabitants of this population cultivate and gather a total of 166 species. Most cultivated species are of exotic origin, whereas a high proportion of gathered species are native plants mainly used for medicinal purposes.

The state farm system was found to be seriously affected by the lack of ecological soil management practices, especially with regard to its tilling activities and its use of chemical fertilizers. The small farmer system has developed a wide-ranging combination of ecological soil management practices, including worm composts, mulches, and artisan ox-drawn plows that maintain soil structure. Fertility management in the cooperative system is a mix of internal nutrient cycling with most crops, and intensive use of chemical fertilizers with crops that are considered strategic to the nation’s food security. CPA cooperative farms were shown to have extensive systems of production, in which very limited access to conventional inputs and labor has created large collective farms with little use of agricultural resources.

Soil management is considered here as a crux of human intervention in agroecosystems, capable of determining the impacts of productive activities upon agricultural and ecosystem functions. Management practices commonly used in each farm system are evaluated using two systems of indicators, one for technological quality and one for agricultural intensification. Soil physical quality is characterized through laboratory analysis of samples taken in the same type of soil under long-term production in state, cooperative, and family farmer cropping systems. Soil structure management in the small farmer system is especially worthy of study, because this agricultural system has developed an intensive agroecological productive model on the basis of low external input use, polycultures and internal nutrient cycling. Favorable policies and farmer organizations are discussed as indispensible elements of sustainable agricultural development.

The implementation of biodiverse homegardens is often seen as a way not only to localize food production but also as a strategy in alignment with a food sovereignty agenda. While much scholarship has characterized and critiqued food security and sovereignty conceptualizations, relatively little research has examined people's lived experiences in order to test how such theoretical visions play out on the ground in farming communities. Based on a case study of four coffee cooperatives in northern Nicaragua, we examine a non-governmental organization (NGO)-supported project promoting food security and sovereignty through development of homegardens. We ask: To what extent are homegardens an effective strategy to reach food sovereignty? And, why may farmers be resistant to changing their food production and consumption strategies to embrace biodiverse homegardens when they improve food security? We discuss characteristics of agroecological homegardens, the distinctions between food security, food sovereignty and dominant discourses of development, the history of food sovereignty in Nicaragua, and farmer perspectives on homegarden implementation. Despite historic critiques, NGOs are poised to facilitate the transformation of food and agricultural development by employing counter development strategies, a necessary step if homegardens are to be successful in the long term. To conclude, we propose some strategies NGOs and communities might pursue to move forward with homegardens as a food sovereignty strategy. This research suggests that a food sovereignty approach still rooted in mainstream development models faces significant obstacles to moving beyond food security and into a farmer-led food sovereignty agenda.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

It explores the role of policy and regulatory frameworks in constructing quality service delivery and intersectoral integration. DESIGN: Review of PNAE and federal government technical documents and studies, legislation, minutes of meetings and official documents of the National Council of Food and Nutrition Security from 2003 to 2011. SETTING: Food insecurity has decreased significantly in Brazil in the last  decade, indicating that appropriate choices were made in terms of public policies and institutional arrangements, which other countries can learn from. SUBJECTS: Brazil food and nutrition security system; school feeding; school food. RESULTS:  Brazil's integrated food and nutrition security policy approach promoted intersectorality in the food system, articulating actions to guarantee access to  healthy food and to strengthen family farming. The quality of school meals has progressively improved; in particular, the availability of fruits and vegetables  increased. However, national standards regarding menu composition have not yet been met. Regulations were an important factor, along with the policy approach linking food production, nutrition, health and education. Challenges are related  to conflict of interests and to farmers' insufficient capacity to meet supply requirements and comply with technical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Local food production, school meals and nutrition education can be linked through integrated programmes and policies, improving access to healthier foods. Government leadership, strong legislation, civil society participation and intersectoral decision making are determinant."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,South America and Caribbean

This article addresses this gap by integrating insights from critical pedagogy, food justice, food sovereignty, and agroecology, developing a new synthetic area of study and research entitled critical food systems education (CFSE). CFSE is composed of a tripartite perspective, consisting of praxis, policy, and pedagogy. This framework is guided by the following overarching question: How can food systems education prepare individuals and teachers to transform the food system, and help communities attain food sovereignty? Following a review of the food systems education literature, we highlight the constraints of the depoliticized approach by drawing attention to its race and class-based assumptions. We then construct a definition of CFSE, and articulate the theoretical and practical cornerstones of this perspective, which are drawn from critical pedagogy, food justice, food sovereignty, and agroecology. A case study of a seed sovereignty project at a vocational high school associated with Brazil's Landless Workers Movement is used to exemplify how CFSE can contribute to educating for food sovereignty."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""jblesh""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,South America and Caribbean

This conceptualization allows studying the cross-level, cross-scale, and nonlinear interactions within and between the components of the system and help assess policy proposals, such as food sovereignty, in a more systemic way. To facilitate this, we link reflections and methodologies from complex system thinking and vulnerability studies applied to agri-food systems to propose an integrated framework of assessment, which links the agroecological context and the social function of agriculture, considering actor's agency and institutional processes. This framework is suitable to analyze agri-food systems in fragile and marginal environments such as the Andean region. We apply the framework to assess vulnerability of local agri-food systems to global change in the southern Ecuadorian Andes, taking into account the role of peasant institutions (agroecological associations, comunas) and indigenous culture.

The article describes regional settlement types, human ecological zones, and occupations, using data from a 1981 survey of 164 households in Beni, Bolivia. Among the survey sample, 99 households were urban, 41 were campesinos and 24 were from estates. Tapping wild rubber trees was the major economic activity. Data are used to demonstrate the contention that stimulating local food production is a necessary part of the general agricultural development of the area. Major topics given consideration are food insecurity, social stratification and the tension between household strategies and the exigencies of subsistence. Food insecurity contributes to indebtedness, residential mobility, and social inequalities. Development issues include the need for increased food production, the patron/debt mode of economic organization as a potential problem for creating extractive reserves, the participation of indigenous ethnic groups, and the need for social, cultural, geographic, and economic data for planning."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no,Developing,South America and Caribbean

In particular, trade liberalization has deepened patterns of food import dependence and the export orientation of peasant farming. But there are also powerful cultural dimensions to food import dependence that further problematize the challenge of pro-poor agrarian change. Food cultures are sometimes underappreciated in the food sovereignty literature, which tends to assume that there will be a preference for local or 'culturally appropriate' foods. In Haiti, historically ingrained and persistent ideologies of racism magnify class hierarchies and the common perceptions of peasants at the bottom of the social order. This paper explores the intersection of socially constructed ideologies of racism with peasant aspirations for socio-cultural mobility, drawing from 30 qualitative interviews with key informants in government, non-governmental organizations, and social movements, and 108 qualitative interviews and 216 food preference surveys that were conducted in three sites in rural Haiti between November 2010 and July 2013. The core argument is that racially-coded class hierarchies exert a powerful influence on dietary aspirations, as 'peasant' foods like millet, root crops and molasses bread are commonly denigrated by Haiti's poor, including peasants themselves, while 'elite' and 'foreign' foods like white flour bread, Corn Flakes, and spaghetti get held up as superior. This suggests a need to appreciate how the cultural geographies of food interact with - and can in fact exacerbate - political and economic inequalities, which raises challenging questions for peasant movements and advocates of food sovereignty."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,South America and Caribbean

At the same time, it is often taken for granted that the root causes of 'poor' dietary choices are financial and time poverty. This paper draws from the case of Haiti to challenge these assumptions, illustrating how food preferences do not always align with tradition, and that even the poorest members of society sometimes opt to pay more for prestigious foods in an attempt to improve their social standing. In Haiti, food hierarchies mirror persistent race and class based social stratifications in troubling ways, and food meanings bear significantly on food choice. It is ultimately argued that possibilities for ecologically integrated and pro-poor food systems demand that small-scale producers, and locally-grounded food systems are revalued."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,South America and Caribbean

Women's autonomy was assessed by a seventeen-item questionnaire covering dimensions of financial independence, household-, child-, reproductive and health-related decision making and freedom of movement. Women's social support was determined using the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire. The scores attained were categorized into tertiles. SETTING: Los Cuatro Santos area,  rural Nicaragua. SUBJECTS: A total of 1371 children 0-35 months of age. RESULTS:  Children of women with the lowest autonomy were more likely to be exclusively breast-fed and continue to be breast-fed, while children of women with middle level of autonomy had better complementary feeding practices. Children of women with the lowest social support were more likely to consume highly processed snacks and/or sugar-sweetened beverages but also be taller.

The premise is twofold: close-grained appreciation of already-interacting biophysical processes allows for the design of complementary social and agricultural systems requiring minimum energy inputs. Secondly, the insistence on campesino smallholders as actors in the design of sustainable food systems directly addresses decades of ""top-down"" developmental interventions, from Green Revolution experiments in the 1960s and 1970s to international food security programmes in the 1990s. Permaculture connects food insecurity to the delegitimisation of smallholder innovation and insists that, through sharing simple techniques, campesino farmers can contribute towards future-oriented questions of environmental sustainability. This repositioning is brought about through the mobilisation of pedagogical techniques that legitimise the experiences and expertise of small-scale farmers, while standardising experimental methods for testing, evaluating and sharing agroecological practices. Like food sovereignty and food justice movements, Salvadoran permaculture links hunger with longer histories of (uneven) capital accumulation and dispossession and renders campesino farmers its protagonists. By modelling a form of expertise premised in intimate involvement with specific environments, permaculture goes still further, seeking to dislodge a pervasive knowledge politics that situates some as knowers and innovators, and others as passive recipients. This grounds human rights in an ethos of caring for the ""more-than-human"" world and places emphasis on a corollary right as part of food justice, increasingly being demanded ""from below"": the right to know.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""jblesh""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 5",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,South America and Caribbean

OBJECTIVE: To explore the different effects of such measures on the health and dietary outcomes of female coffee and  food small holder farmers in Uganda. METHODS: We gathered evidence through a cross-sectional comparative interview survey of 190 female coffee producers and 191 female food producers in Ntungamo district. The study mostly employed quantitative methods of data collection, targeting the sampled households. We also utilized qualitative data; collected three months after the household survey data had been collected and their analysis had been accomplished. Using qualitative interviews based on an unstructured interview guide, extra qualitative information was collected from key informants at national, district and community levels. This was among other underlying principles to avoid relying on snapshot information earlier collected at household level in order to draw valid and compelling conclusions from the study. We used indicators of production, income, access to food and dietary patterns, women's health and health care. Of the two groups selected from the same area, female coffee producers represented a higher level of integration into liberalised export markets. RESULTS: Document review suggests that, although Uganda's economy grew in the period, the household economic and social gains after the liberalization measures may have been less than expected. In the survey carried out, both food and coffee producers were similarly poor, involved in small-scale production, and of a similar age and education level. Coffee producers had greater land and livestock ownership, greater access to inputs and higher levels of income and used a wider variety of markets than food producers, but they had to work longer  hours to obtain these economic returns, and spent more cash on health care and food from commercial sources. Their health outcomes were similar to those of the  food producers, but with poorer dietary outcomes and greater food stress. CONCLUSIONS: The small-scale women farmers who are producing food cannot rely on  the economic infrastructure to give them support for meaningful levels of production. However, despite having higher incomes than their food producing counterparts, the evidence showed that women who are producing coffee in Uganda as an export commodity cannot rely on the income from their crops to guarantee their health and nutritional wellbeing, and that the income advantage gained in coffee-producing households has not translated into consistently better health or food security outcomes.

If successful, the model would also produce benefits around biodiversity conservation, environmental sustainability and diverse diets in this part of Kenya where high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity persist despite the abundance of local nutritious biodiversity. Two years down the line, the ACIAR project has successfully developed a holistic pilot to connect production and consumption of local edible biodiversity and established an enabling environment in the county for a workable food procurement model that puts local food diversity at its core and which can potentially be rolled out in other locations. First steps included the development of an adapted Farmer Business School (FBS) model, which includes elements of group strengthening, local food production, nutrition education, business management and marketing. Secondly, training was provided to 547 men and women farmers from Busia's seven sub-counties who are now better equipped to penetrate local markets, apply and win tenders from public institutions and compete with other suppliers. All along, nutrition education and awareness activities were carried out to increase awareness and demand for local nutritious crops. Since the pilot was launched in one school in mid-2016 catering for 410 students, the farm-to-school network is now providing healthy school meals to approximately 5,500 pupils. The linking of farmer groups to schools and health clinics has created employment opportunities for the farmers who now have a steady market for their produce while schools see the relationship of linking to local farmers as part of their social corporate responsibility and assured safe vegetable supply. Furthermore, the pilot study, along with the Biodiversity for Food and Nutrition (BFN) project, helped facilitate the development of the first biodiversity policy for Busia County and for the rest of Kenya. The policy, still awaiting approval, provides a framework for the effective conservation and use of biodiversity and proposes that at least 30% of food procured by schools and hospitals must be locally-sourced and coming from family farmers. Project achievements are also feeding into the development of a County Nutrition Action Plan (CNAP) aimed at providing a framework for coordinated high impact nutrition interventions by county government and nutrition stakeholders."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,SubSaharan Africa

The theoretical concern of this paper is with issues of identity formation and continuity through the materiality of food and food systems, in the context of varying assumptions underlying discourses of development. The Suri people remain at the margins of the modernizing Ethiopian state and experienced a decline in food security, health and wealth in the last decade, coinciding with growing inter-group tension and new state developmental plans which devalue the agro-pastoral mode of life. State support or investment is in massive sugar and other mono-crop plantations and in enterprises by foreigners and private capitalists, not matched by parallel investment in local economies of agro-pastoralism and crop cultivation. Some of the effects on the production system, diet and 'food sovereignty' of the Suri are described so as to highlight the challenges they face, including growing internal differentiation, pressure on modifying their food system and the increasing sale and use of alcoholic drinks.

The intersection of gender and class dynamics, combined with state policies, however, works to undermine food sovereignty for particular groups in northern Malawi. Historical processes of exclusion, dispossession and exploitation changed the division of labour and reduced time and land for diverse farming systems. State policies reduced knowledge and availability of preferred local varieties. While peasants, particularly women, have considerable knowledge of seed varieties, and seeds continue to be exchanged in agrarian communities, young women, tenant farmers, food insecure younger couples and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-affected families are particularly vulnerable to reduced food sovereignty, in part due to gender inequalities, unequal land distribution and social stigma. New efforts to strengthen food sovereignty need to build on community and kin relations, while addressing social inequalities.

METHODS: Multi-stage stratified sampling was used to select 749 farming households living in three coffee producing sub-districts of Jimma zone, Ethiopia. Domains of women's Autonomy were measured by a tool adapted from demographic health survey. A model for determination of paternal involvement in childcare was employed. Caring practices were assessed through the WHO Infant and young child feeding practice core indicators. Length and weight measurements were taken in duplicate using standard techniques. Data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 21. A multivariable linear regression was used to predict weight  for height Z-scores and length for age Z-scores after adjusting for various factors. RESULTS: The mean (sd) scores of weight for age (WAZ), height for age (HAZ), weight for height (WHZ) and BMI for age (BAZ) was -0.52(1.26), -0.73(1.43), -0.13(1.34) and -0.1(1.39) respectively. The results of multi variable linear regression analyses showed that WHZ scores of children of mothers who had autonomy of conducting big purchase were higher by 0.42 compared to children's whose mothers had not. In addition, a child whose father was involved  in childcare and feeding had higher HAZ score by 0.1. Regarding age, as for every month increase in age of child, a 0.04 point decrease in HAZ score and a 0.01 point decrease in WHZ were noted. Similarly, a child living in food insecure households had lower HAZ score by 0.29 compared to child of food secured households. As family size increased by a person a WHZ score of a child is decreased by 0.08. WHZ and HAZ scores of male child was found lower by 0.25 and 0.38 respectively compared to a female child of same age.

Starchy staple foods dominate the diets in these settings. This places the population, especially women of reproductive age, at a risk of micronutrients deficiencies. This study seeks to examine the association between women's decision-making autonomy and women's achievement of higher dietary diversity (DD) and determine the socio-demographic  factors that can independently predict women's attainment of higher DD. METHODS:  The study used data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. The participants comprised of 2262 women aged 15-49 years and who have complete dietary data. The DD score was derived from a 24-h recall of intake of foods from nine groups. The score was dichotomized into lower DD (DD </=4) and higher (DD >/=5). Logistic regression was used to assess the association between women decision-making autonomy (final say on how to spend money, making household purchases, own health care, opinions on wife-beating, and sexual intercourse with husband) and the achievement of higher DD. The logistic regression models were adjusted for covariates at the individual and household levels. RESULTS: The analysis showed that women participation in decision-making regarding household purchases was significantly associated with higher DD, after adjusting for individual and household level covariates. The odds of achieving higher DD were higher among women who had a say in deciding household purchases, compared to women who did not have a say (OR = 1.74, 95 % CI = 1.24, 2.42). Women who had more than primary education were 1.6 times more likely to achieve higher DD, compared to those with no education (95 % CI = 1.12, 2.20). Compared to women who lived in polygamous households, those who lived in monogamous households had higher odds of achieving higher DD (OR = 1.42, 95 % CI = 1.04, 1.93). CONCLUSIONS: Net other covariates, women who have a say in making household purchases are more likely to achieve higher DD compare to those who do not have a say.

This study was directed by a developing theory of maternal capabilities that posits that the impact of health-directed interventions may be  limited by unmeasured and poorly understood maternal characteristics. Ugandan caregivers defined three major life events that constrain women's capabilities for childcare: early pregnancy, close child spacing, and polygamous marriage. Women describe major constraints in their decision-making capabilities generally  and specifically to procuring food for young children. Future nutrition programs  may improve their impact through activities that model household decision-making  scenarios, and that strengthen women's social support networks. Findings suggest  that efforts to transform gender norms may be one additional way to improve nutrition outcomes in communities with a generally low status of women relative to men. The willingness of younger fathers to challenge traditional gender norms  suggests an opportunity in this context for continued work to strengthen resources for children's nutritional care. SIGNIFICANCE: Maternal factors such as autonomy are associated with child feeding practices and nutritional status, with varying degrees depending on the definition of maternal-level constructs and context. This study describes the events and processes that constrain maternal capabilities-intrapersonal factors that shape mother's abilities to leverage resources to provide care to children-as they relate to nutrition and hygiene practices.

The authority of the healthcare workers was at its peak when the child was born and faded gradually as the child grew. Building maternal competence is important for child-feeding outcomes, but our data showed that the health education methods used by the healthcare workers were inadequate to improve maternal to improve the motivation.

In this very harsh environment, agriculture is characterized by a great diversity of fruit varieties central to local food culture and household security. Local fruit trees can grow in poor soils on slopes and their resistance to diseases, cold, and ultraviolet light give them marked advantages over introduced varieties. However, the humanitarian crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union and recent efforts by development organizations to create markets by introducing exotic varieties are negatively affecting agricultural biodiversity (agrobiodiversity) and, potentially, household security. A study was carried out in 3 districts of the Gorno-Badakhshan province to investigate the household consumption and market potential of products derived from local varieties of apple, apricot, and mulberry and how these products could be better exploited to benefit community livelihoods and agrobiodiversity conservation. Results show that fruit represents the farmers' main source of food and income. Many local varieties are maintained for a variety of reasons related to household consumption, whereas the main reason for cultivating introduced varieties is income generation. Great care must therefore be taken in planning market strategies: a pure market focus will almost certainly endanger household security, whereas a strategy linking income generation through the commercialization of crop varieties to the promotion of qualities central to household needs will improve diversity and public health. The opportunities identified to help enhance the market potential of local fruits and maintain the Pamir's unique biocultural heritage include efforts to raise public awareness among producers and consumers of the nutritional and medicinal properties of local varieties; training for pest management, processing, and packaging; and the establishment of farmers' cooperatives.","12

This is particularly due to the transparency and traceability characteristic of a short supply chain and social aspects related to food origins. The trend has been increasingly common during the past decade in Europe and North America, and it is strongly evident in the case area of this study in Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. In general, ease of access to food is highly important for consumers and crucial for institutional kitchens, in addition to quality aspects and price. However, regardless of proximity, poor accessibility is one of the key issues preventing the further growth of local food markets. Due to scale economics in food value chain, food transport is presently organised mainly by centralised, large-scale logistics companies directed via hubs serving millions of consumers. Accordingly, production volumes required to enter large-scale markets are often unattainable for disjointed small-scale local food producers. In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based accessibility analyses are applied for analysing potential for integral networking of local food production and transport companies. Berry production was selected as a case study because it has a relatively strong role in Northern Ostrobothnia, while its logistics are notably underdeveloped. Spatial data of primary production volumes consists of register records of farm-specific cultivation areas and average yields in Northern Ostrobothnia and Finland. Accessibility computations are based on the digital model of the Finnish road network, Digiroad. Two surveys were also implemented to farmers and food processing companies to seek views on food processing, sales, logistics and procurements regarding local food. Data from the surveys was used in accessibility analysis, which enables exploration of opportunities for establishing 'local food' clusters integrating small producers into a more effective and competitive network. Information about favourable conditions for cooperative networks in the local food sector may help in establishing companies and their growth.

Due to the limiting factors of the urban environment (e.g., land availability), UA often occupies the roofs of buildings as vacant space to further develop local food production through so-called urban rooftop agriculture (URA). This paper presents an interdisciplinary scheme employed to evaluate the sustainability of URA as a complex system while investigating the potential of URA in quantitative and qualitative terms as well as the environmental and economic impact of different types of URA. The implementation of URA, as a specific form of UA, in a Mediterranean context was assessed using Barcelona, Spain and Bologna, Italy as case studies. Interdisciplinary methods from four disciplines were combined: (a) qualitative research to identify the potential of URA by evaluating the perceptions of different stakeholders; (b) geographic information systems (GIS), to quantify the potential area for implementing URA; (c) life cycle assessment (LCA), to quantify the environmental impacts of URA forms; and (d) life cycle costing (LCC), to quantify the economic costs of URA forms. According to the results, a combined GIS-LCA tool is useful in evaluating the implementation of URA and the consequent environmental benefits at the city scale. Stakeholders highlighted the contribution of URA to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as the potential risks tied to its complexity and novelty. Comparing different urban spaces, the implementation of URA is more feasible in the short-term on the roofs of retail parks than industrial ones. At the system scale, soil cultivation with compost in open-air rooftop gardens resulted in the most eco-efficient cultivation option.

Understanding the nature of this work is one key to being able to more effectively support and expand it. The literature, however, contains little scholarly work characterizing production-related practices of food justice CBOs. To help fill that gap, this paper draws from participatory action research with five CBOs to identify and characterize their community food production activities and goals. This research was conducted over five years, during a project called Food Dignity, using three main methods: digital storytelling; collaborative pathway modeling; and conventional case study methods that included interviews, participation and observation, and document analysis. These data sets were examined to identify what production activities the CBOs support and why they undertake them. Results suggest that the CBOs invest in community food production in eight main ways. Five are directly related to food. Listed roughly in decreasing order of intensity and frequency of the activities, these are (1) growing vegetables and fruits, (2) supporting community gardens, (3) supporting individual gardeners, (4) supporting local farmers, and (5) fostering other kinds of food production. Additionally, three crosscutting strategies underpin all the CBOs' work, including community food production: (6) connecting people and organizations, (7) promoting community food systems, and (8) integrating their activities with community (as opposed to food) at the center. The CBOs' goals for these activities are transformational, including achieving community-led and sustainable food security, health, and economic equity. The CBOs' crosscutting activities and longterm goals point to supporting and assessing outcomes that include food production and access but are also nonfood related, such as leadership development and feelings of belonging or ownership. Their wide range of food production activities and social change goals need more support for expansion, trial and error, documentation, and assessment. In particular, intentionally supporting food justice CBOs in their crosscutting strategies, which are foundational and yet less visible and underfunded, may multiply the range and reach of their impacts."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,

Method: A narrative review was formed drawing on international literature and Canadian research and practice. Results: Strategies such as those described above have the potential to significantly enhance access to affordable, nutritious food in Northern Communities thereby improving food security, healthy living and preventing chronic disease. Conclusions: Community-based action combined with structural changes and a supportive policy environment hold out the prospect of changing the conditions of food access that underlie the ultimate success of healthy living and chronic disease prevention efforts.

From 1988 onward institutional structures were established: the National Council of FNS (CONSEA) convenes government and civil society sectors to develop and monitor the implementation of policies, systems and actions. Social participation has been at the heart of structural changes achieved since then. Nevertheless, the country faces multiple challenges regarding FNS such as the double burden of disease, increasing use of pesticides and genetically modified seeds, weak regulation of ultra-processed products, and marketing practices that affect the environment, population health, and food sovereignty.

Food policies in Mexico are characterized by reflecting the international pattern of the food security approach, linked to the new global agro-food system, in which poverty and food insecurity constitute an opportunity for the corporate food regime that limits access to food to millions of people. It is concluded that food security in Mexico has been limited to social policies to combat poverty, devoid of recognition that it is a structural problem of asymmetric economic development, so despite government efforts, poverty and food insecurity have not been reversed.

However, certain Swiss agricultural policy instruments, even where they are compatible with relevant rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), do have an avoidable negative impact on the Right to Food of developing country producers, because Swiss Food Security is overwhelmingly and increasingly defined by agricultural (self-reliance) policies (""Food Sovereignty""). This implies higher domestic food prices, commercial displacement and food dumping.

In February 2007, over 600 civil society representatives came together at the International Forum on Food Sovereignty in Selingue, a village in the Malian countryside. The debates resulted in a strong declaration on the concept of food sovereignty. The definition of food sovereignty closely resembles existing international human rights standards, thus, the potential of human rights to offer important protective mechanisms is discovered or rediscovered. According to the country's 2007 Population Report, about 31% of the Uganda population still lives in extreme poverty and hunger. Overall access to adequate food in Uganda and the whole of Africa relies heavily on the work of women to produce 80% of the food. And yet, women are second rate in most Ugandan cultures. So while women are among the first victims of violations of the right to food, they are also the key to its realization. As a country receiving FAO support, Uganda is a pioneer in establishing a framework law on the right to food that will ensure policy coherence. Based on these achievements in the national legal framework, a network of NGOs and Civil Society Organizations has started to apply the Voluntary Guidelines to monitor the Ugandan government's activities in fighting hunger and malnutrition and to hold the state accountable for violations of the right to food.

The MST and Via Campesina seek to replace existing rights to 'food security' with a human right to 'food sovereignty'. While food security agendas emphasise the role of international governance agencies in providing food on behalf of others, food sovereignty is secured by peasant social movements themselves. Furthermore, practices of active citizenship and democratic organisational structures, built through the grassroots and transnational struggles through which peasants raise their demand for human rights, are vital in enacting rights to food sovereignty. In instances where victims are not entirely silenced and powerless, this combination of a demand for human rights and the development of practices of citizenship that enable people to demand and secure rights for themselves provides a contextually grounded emancipatory alternative to interventionist politics that, however well intentioned, risk reinforcing the dependence of purportedly powerless victims."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>false, “Barbara""=>true “Devon""=>true}",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no,,

They have recently tended to add protectionist, populist and voluntarist accents to the national and international policies fighting food insecurity in Africa. Beyond the different status of these two concepts, we look at the connection between the ideas, as well as speeches which they produce. Our results rely on a textual analysis of secondary documents and interviews with representatives of French international solidarity organizations present in Africa and international networks hired to advocate food sovereignty. We begin by exploring the Right to Adequate Food Supply and Food Sovereignty and focus on their well differentiated contexts of emergence to underline their present-day relationship as parts of supplementary strategies of influence: the former favours the judicial treatment of the food issue and the second its political treatment. We show that both ideas refer to an actual renovation of food security policy objectives and governance which possibly implies an alternative food system based on a certain level of food autonomy and political regulation of agro-food sectors."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""annelie.bernhart""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Several studies in diverse areas worldwide have pointed out the importance of wild food plants (WFPs) for assuring food sovereignty and food security, and therefore the current study was aimed at documenting traditional knowledge of WFPs and analyzing how this varies among generations. METHODS: Ethnobotanical data were collected during 2010-2012. In total of seventy-two informants were interviewed in ten villages via in-depth interviews and group discussions with key informants followed by freelisting. Data were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics and novelty was checked by comparing the gathered data with the published literature. RESULTS: A total of fifty-one WFP species belonging to twenty-eight families were documented. Rosaceae was the dominant family with the largest number of species and highest frequency of citation (FC). July was the peak month for availability of WFPs, and fruit was the most commonly consumed part. Among the most cited species, Olea ferrugenia was ranked first with a FC = 1, followed by Amaranthus spinosus (FC =  0.93). Of the documented species about 14 % (7) were marketable and 27 % (14) were reported for the first time to be used as WFP species in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: WFPs still play an important role in the food and culture of the study area and the folk knowledge attached to them is remarkable in the region, although declining among the younger generations. The recorded species needs to be re-evaluated in local projects aimed at fostering endogenous strategies of food security, as well as re-evaluating cultural heritage and sustaining small-scale food market circuits.","<p>Last updated - 2018-06-13</p>

Human health is an implied component of this definition through the principle of healthy food. In fact, improved human health is commonly cited as a benefit of transforming food production away from the dominant practices of industrial agriculture. Yet, does the use of ""ecologically sound and sustainable methods"" of food production necessarily translate into better human health outcomes? Does greater choice in defining an agricultural or food system create gains in health  and well-being? We elucidate the conceptual linkages between food sovereignty and human health, critically examine the empirical evidence supporting or refuting these linkages, and identify research gaps and key priorities for the food sovereignty-human health research agenda. Five domains of food sovereignty are discussed including: (1) use of agroecological management practices for food production, (2) the localization of food production and consumption, (3) promotion of social justice and equity, (4) valuation of traditional knowledge, and (5) the transformation of economic and political institutions and structures  to support self-determination. We find that although there are many plausible linkages between food sovereignty and human health, the empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that increasing food sovereignty yields improvements to human health is weak. We propose that a concerted effort to generate new empirical evidence on the health implications of these domains of food sovereignty is urgently needed, and suggest areas of research that may be crucial for addressing the gaps in the evidence base."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Cash transfers, as part of safety net approach, have potential to prevent under-nutrition. However,  most of the cash transfer programs implemented and scientifically evaluated do not have a clear nutritional objective, which leads to a lack of evidence regarding their nutritional benefits. METHODS/DESIGN: The MAM'Out research project aims at evaluating a seasonal and multiannual cash transfer program to prevent acute malnutrition in children under 36 months, in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the Tapoa province (Eastern region of Burkina Faso, Africa). The program is targeted to economically vulnerable households with children less than 1 year old at the time of inclusion. Cash is distributed to mothers and the transfers are unconditional, leading to beneficiaries' self-determination on the use of cash. The study is designed as a two-arm cluster randomized intervention trial, based on the randomization of rural villages. One  group receives cash transfers via mobile phones and one is a control group. The main outcomes are the cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition and the cost-effectiveness.

We sought to understand the state of knowledge on relationships  between health equity--i.e. health inequalities that are socially produced--and food systems, where the concepts of 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' are prominent. We undertook exploratory scoping and mapping stages of a 'meta-narrative synthesis' on pathways from global food systems to health equity  outcomes. The review was oriented by a conceptual framework delineating eight pathways to health (in)equity through the food system: 1--Multi-Scalar Environmental, Social Context; 2--Occupational Exposures; 3--Environmental Change; 4--Traditional Livelihoods, Cultural Continuity; 5--Intake of Contaminants; 6--Nutrition; 7--Social Determinants of Health and 8--Political, Economic and Regulatory context. The terms 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' were, respectively, paired with a series of health equity-related terms. Combinations of health equity and food security (1414 citations) greatly outnumbered pairings with food sovereignty (18 citations). Prominent crosscutting themes that were observed included climate change, biotechnology, gender, racialization, indigeneity, poverty, citizenship and HIV as well as institutional barriers to reducing health inequities in the food system. The literature indicates that food sovereignty-based approaches to health in specific contexts,  such as advancing healthy school food systems, promoting soil fertility, gender equity and nutrition, and addressing structural racism, can complement the longer-term socio-political restructuring processes that health equity requires.  Our conceptual model offers a useful starting point for identifying interventions with strong potential to promote health equity. A research agenda to explore project-based interventions in the food system along these pathways can support the identification of ways to strengthen both food sovereignty and health equity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nicholas""=>false, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: possible framing paper | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2.

S.",2013,Rural and remote health,Peer reviewed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445-6354,13,2,2211,,,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: In Canada, food insecurity exists among Aboriginal (Inuit, Metis and First Nations) people living in remote northern communities, in part, because of their reliance on the industrialized, import-based food system. Local food production as a substitute to imports would be an adaptive response, but enhancement of food security via food localization requires reflection on previous failings of conventional agricultural strategies so that informed decisions can be made. In light of potential reintroduction of local food production in remote First Nations communities, we investigated the cultural, social and ecological effects of a 20th century, Euro-Canadian agrarian settlement on the food system of a subarctic First Nation; this will act as the first step in developing a more sustainable local food program and enhancing food security in this community. METHODS: To investigate the socio-cultural impacts of the Euro-Canadian agrarian initiative on the food system of Fort Albany First Nation, purposive, semi-directive interviews were conducted with elders and other knowledgeable community members. Interview data were placed into themes using inductive analyses. To determine the biophysical impact of the agrarian initiative, soil samples were taken from one site within the cultivated area and  from one site in an undisturbed forest area. Soil properties associated with agricultural use and productivity were assessed. To compare the means of a given  soil property between the sites, one-tailed <i>t</i>-tests were employed. Vegetative analysis was conducted in both sites to assess disturbance. RESULTS: According to the interviewees, prior to the agrarian initiative, First Nation families harvested wild game and fish, and gathered berries as well as other forms of vegetation for sustenance. With the introduction of the residential school and agrarian initiative, traditional food practices were deemed inadequate, families were forced to work and live in the settlement (becoming less reliant on traditional foods), and yet little knowledge sharing of agricultural practices occurred. When the residential school and agrarian movement came to an end in the 1970s, First Nation community members were left to become reliant on an import food system. The mission's agrarian techniques resulted in overall degradation of soil quality and ecological integrity: compared the natural boreal forest, the cultivated area had been colonized by invasive species and had significantly lower soil levels of nitrogen, magnesium and organic carbon, and significantly higher levels of phosphorus and bulk density. CONCLUSIONS: Because the agrarian initiative was not a viable long-term  approach to food security in Fort Albany, the people became more reliant on imported goods. Taking into account climate change, there exists an opportunity whereby fruits and vegetables, historically stunted-in-growth or outside the distributional range of subarctic Canada, could now grow in the north. Together,  agroecosystem stewardship practices and community-based, autonomous food security programs have the potential to increase locally grown food availability in a sustainable manner."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Go-along interviews were conducted with 26 residents of Sandwell, a uniformly deprived metropolitan borough in the West Midlands, UK. Routine approaches to food shopping are characterised in terms of planning and reliance on the supermarket environment. Four distinct routines are identified: chaotic and reactive; working around the store; item-by-item; and restricted and budgeted. This suggests that residents of deprived neighbourhoods do not have uniform responses to food environments. Responses to supermarket environments appear to be mediated by levels of individual autonomy.

METHODS: We engaged in iterative cycles of mixed methods research around particular questions, actions relevant to stakeholders, new proposal formulation and implementation followed by evaluation of impacts. Capacity building occurred among farmers, technical personnel, and students from multiple  disciplines. Involvement of research users occurred throughout: women and men farmers, non-governmental development organizations, Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and, in Ecuador, the National Council on Social Participation. RESULTS: Pesticide poisonings were more widespread than existing passive surveillance systems would suggest. More diversified, moderately developed agricultural systems had lower pesticide use and better child nutrition. Greater  understanding among women of crop management options and more equal household gender relations were associated with reduced farm pesticide use and household pesticide exposure. Involvement in more organic agriculture was associated with greater household food security and food sovereignty. Markets for safer produce supported efforts by smallholder farmers to reduce hazardous pesticide use.Participatory interventions included: promoting greater access to alternative methods and inputs in a store co-sponsored by the municipality; producing less harmful inputs such as compost by women farmers; strengthening farmer organizations around healthier and more sustainable agriculture; marketing safer  produce among social sectors; empowering farmers to act as social monitors; and using social monitoring results to inform decision makers. Uptake by policy makers has included: the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health rolling out pesticide poisoning surveillance modeled on our system; the Ecuadorian Association of Municipalities holding a national virtual forum on healthier agriculture; and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture promulgating restrictions on highly hazardous  pesticides in June 2010.

Semi-structured interviews using the Food Choice Map were conducted with eleven middle-income employed mothers of elementary school-age children. Results demonstrated that the women exhibited conflicting identities with respect to food choice and provisioning. As 'good mothers' they were the primary food and nutrition caregivers for the family, desiring to provide healthy, homemade foods  their families preferred at shared family meals. They also sought to be independent selves, working outside the home, within the context of a busy modern family. Increased food autonomy of children, and lack of time due to working outside the home and children's involvement in extracurricular activities, were significant influences on their food choice and provisioning. This resulted in frequently being unable to live up to their expectations of consistently providing healthy homemade foods and having shared family meals. To cope, the women frequently relied on processed convenience and fast foods despite their acknowledged inferior nutritional status. Using Giddens' structuration theory, the dynamic relationships between the women's food choice and provisioning actions, their identities and larger structures including socio-cultural norms, conditions of work and the industrial food system were explored. The ensuing dietary pattern of the women and their families increases the risk of poor health outcomes, including obesity. These results have implications for public health responses to improve population health by shifting the focus from individual-level maternal influences to structural influences on diet."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

The data were subjected to post-hoc methods of quality determination, and, if of suitable quality, included in the adequacy evaluation. RESULTS: Most collected data were of moderate or high quality and therefore included in the adequacy evaluation. There were moderate to large improvements in vitamin A status in Ethiopian school-age children, children <5 years of age in Tanzania and Ghana and mothers in Ghana. Iodine status improved in Malawi and Tanzania. Anaemia rates and malaria prevalence decreased in women, pregnant women and pre-school children in  Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania, but anaemia increased in Ethiopian women. Large increases were reported for rates of exclusive breastfeeding and immunization. Child growth improved to the maximum that would be predicted with the given interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous nutrition and health impacts were observed in the intervention areas, often of a magnitude equal to or larger than observed  in controlled interventions or trials. These results show the value of integrated long-term interventions."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

These recommendations are challenging for rural elders whose functional limitations, fewer resources, and limited access to foods negatively affect the quality of their diets. The purpose of this study was to characterize the diet quality of a multiethnic population-based sample of older adults (N=635) in the southern United States. Data were collected via home visit; dietary intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and converted into Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) scores used to monitor adherence to dietary guidelines. The mean total HEI-2005 score was 61.9/100 with fewer than 2% meeting the recommended score of 80/100. After controlling for age, sex, marital status, poverty status, and education, African Americans (n=136) had higher total HEI-2005 scores compared to American Indians (n=195) and non-Hispanic whites (n=304) (64.5 vs 60.1 and 61.1 respectively, P=0.001). Certain HEI-2005 foods were consumed in greater amounts by particular groups, such as total fruit and meat and beans (African Americans), whole fruit and grains (African Americans and American Indians), milk (non-Hispanic whites), and energy from solid fat, alcohol, and added sugars (American Indians). The overall diet quality of these rural elders was not adequate as determined by the HEI-2005; however, intakes of dark green and orange vegetables were adequate, and many participants were in compliance with the added fat and sugar guidelines. Determination of factors that promote or prevent the consumption of healthful foods among rural elders may help tailor nutrition education programs for these vulnerable communities."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Demographic, socioeconomic, expenditure and coping strategy data were collected from 200 women of poor households in a rural community in Malaysia. Households were categorized  as either food secure (n=84) or food insecure (n=116) using the Radimer/Cornell Hunger and Food Insecurity instrument. T-test, Chi-square and logistic regression were utilized for comparison of factors between food secure and food insecure households and determination of factors associated with household food insecurity, respectively. More of the food insecure households were living below  the poverty line, had a larger household size, more children and school-going children and mothers as housewives. As food insecure households had more school-going children, reducing expenditures on the children's education is an important strategy to reduce household expenditures. Borrowing money to buy foods, receiving foods from family members, relatives and neighbors and reducing  the number of meals seemed to cushion the food insecure households from experiencing food insufficiency. Most of the food insecure households adopted the strategy on cooking whatever is available at home for their meals. The logistic regression model indicates that food insecure households were likely to have more children (OR=1.71; p<0.05) and non-working mothers (OR=6.15; p<0.05), did not own any land (OR=3.18; p<0.05) and adopted the strategy of food preparation based on  whatever is available at their homes (OR=4.33; p<0.05). However, mothers who reported to borrow money to purchase food (OR=0.84; p<0.05) and households with higher incomes of fathers (OR=0.99; p<0.05) were more likely to be food secure. Understanding the factors that contribute to household food insecurity is imperative so that effective strategies could be developed and implemented."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

It is generally agreed, and is the basis of much United Nations, especially Food and Agriculture  Organisation strategic development policy, that successful agriculture, horticulture and aquaculture along with fishing, underpin economically viable and healthy communities with their various food cultures. We also know that this must be in tandem with maternal literacy and operational health care systems. These elements are best represented on a regional basis. There is a growing consumer interest in knowing where one's food comes from as a measure of ""food integrity"". However, food production alone can be a precarious business and relate to a lesser or greater extent to local food culture and to trade, which may be complementary or at-odds with each other. Likewise, the local food culture may have its strengths and weaknesses as far as its ability to meet nutritional and health needs is concerned. Local food production may be restricted because of geographical or socio-economic conditions which preclude food diversity, although this may be compensated for by trade. Where food adequacy and diversity is compromised, and soils poor, various macronutrient, micronutrient (from animals and plants) and phytonutrient (nutritionally-advantageous food component from plants) deficiencies may be in evidence. These food system problems may be intertwined with food culture--for example, ""rice-based and water-soluble vitamin poor""; ""few animal-derived foods like meat, fish, eggs and milk with associated low calcium, vitamin D, Vitamin B12 and long chain n-3 fatty acid intakes""; ""low  fruit and vegetable intake with limited carotenoids and other phytonutrients"". Geo-satellite surveillance and mapping as identifying such ""hot spots"": for regional food problems, as well as hot spots where most of the world's biodiversity is found (1.4 % of land on earth). On the other hand, regional food  culture can confer considerable advantage for health and economic development, but does not necessarily do so. The challenge is to respect and retain traditional food knowledge and sustainable food systems, with good governance for food security. There has been a recent awakening of interest and concern about the lack of documentation of traditional and indigenous food cultures which are important not only for their own sake, but for the legacy of food knowledge which they can confer on future generations, provided they are not lost. Hence, the value of a special focus on African food cultures (www.healthyeatingclub.org/Africa), including Rift and Nile Valleys and North West African foods, which are the cradles of human food systems and habits. This  is the case too with indigenous foods and food cultures (whether hunter-gatherer  or subsistence agriculture); with relatively long-living food cultures in North East Asia, with food cultural distinction and fusion (FHILL and SENECA studies) and with migratory Food Habits. By and large, there is a remarkable resilience and ingenuity of people and their food systems, but monoculture and lack of diversity encourage food system failure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nicholas""=>false, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5.

The demographic characteristics showed that half of the population studied were between 60-69 years, 53% male, 61% married and 58% had no formal education. Based on Body Mass  Index (BMI), more than half of the respondents had an acceptable nutritional status with a BMI between 18- 25 (63%male; 58% female) whilst 15% of the males and 14% of the females were underweight with BMIs below 18 and 3% of the males had severe malnutrition (BMI below 15). According to the nutritional vulnerability checklist, only 10% of the males and 4% of the females were not nutritionally vulnerable. The majority were either moderately vulnerable or (50%  male; 50% female) or highly vulnerable (39% male and 46% female). Stepwise regression analysis identified ten factors contributing to nutritional vulnerability in the elderly: environmental health; food intake, food security; family life; psychological situation; functional capacity; health status; economic situation; alcoholism; and bereavement, with the coefficient of multiple determination of 0.94 at P < 0.05 (R = 0.94 P<0.05).

Vitamin A deficiency and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, have become serious problems in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)  following the decreased production and consumption of locally grown foods. However, agricultural and social conditions are still favourable for local food production. AIM: To identify key factors to consider in a Micronesian food-based  intervention focusing on increased production and consumption of four major Micronesian staple foods: banana, breadfruit, giant swamp taro and pandanus. METHODS: Ethnographic methods including key informant interviews and a literature review. RESULTS: Pacific and Micronesian values, concepts of food and disease, and food classifications differ sharply from Western concepts. There are few FSM  professionals with nutrition expertise. Traditional foods and food cultivars vary in nutrient content, consumption level, cost, availability, status, convenience in growing, storing and cooking, and organoleptic factors. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic consideration of the factors that relate to a food-based intervention  is critical to its success. The evaluation of which food and cultivar of that food that might be most effectively promoted is also critical. Regional differences, for example FSM inter-island differences between the staple foods and cultivars, must be considered carefully. The evaluation framework presented here may be relevant to Pacific Island and other countries with similar foods where food-based interventions are being planned. An ethnographic approach was found to be essential in understanding the cultural context and in data collection and analysis."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

These facts combined with ethnic tensions created a decade of conflict and oppression affecting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. Thousands of Kosovars moved overseas to seek work to support families  at home, altering the way of life of the population of Kosovo irredeemably. The loss of income had serious repercussions on food security throughout the 1990s; possibilities of purchasing food were diminished, control on goods in 1998 reduced availability of foodstuffs, conflict affected accessibility to markets and shops and consequently food intake and nutritional status was compromised. The most vulnerable were those who had no family members overseas. Mass displacement of population due to ethnic cleansing during the war of spring 1999, further jeopardised food security status. Destruction at this time rendered large parts of Kosovo useless and resulted in a shift in the determinant of vulnerability in the post-war period: destruction of houses, land, livestock and  agricultural products as well as loss of family members, became a far more pertinent indicator of food insecurity. The strong and clear links between conflict, socio-economic issues and food security are highlighted and discussed in this paper.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcela""=>true, ""jblesh""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 1",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no,,

The functional unit of the assessment was 1 kg of harvested fresh vegetable at the consumption point, and the ReCiPe method was employed for impact assessment. Environmental assessment indicated that organic fertilization, use of tap water, mineral fertilization and pesticides were the most contributing elements of the entire life cycle. Furthermore, the relevance of garden design and crop selection was a determinant in the eco-efficiency results.

The contributions to this special issue explore ways of conceptualising agriculture and the rural. For some, a leading question is whether and how processes of repeasantisation and re-agrarianisation are relevant to robust agrarian pathways. Other contributions prefer relational approaches and analyse transformation processes using concepts like 'territory' and '(re-and/or de-)territorialisation', 'landscape' and 'assemblages' to examine processes of change in the rural domain. They share the premise that it is worthwhile exploring the underlying dynamics of these processes as real and representing agrarian pathways that hold the promise of a dynamic agrarian future and vibrant countrysides. The articles also agree on the need to go beyond understanding development as unilinear and dichotomous.

In this paper, we apply social movement framing theory to empirically identify prognostic, diagnostic, and motivational frames in the growing food justice movement in the U.S. We use the case of the Food Dignity project, a five-year, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)-funded, action and research collaboration between academics and leaders at five community-based food justice organizations. We coded multiple data sources, both public and internal to the project, to identify the strongest and most common diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames used by 25 individual collaborators in the Food Dignity project. Results suggest that the majority of diagnostic frames used by Food Dignity partners did not relate directly to food, but included instead insufficient resources, loss of place, degraded community, and constrained choice and response-ability (Minkler, 1999) as causes of problems though a broken food system also emerged as a causal frame. Similarly, solution framing included one overarching food-related strategy, which we labelled ""great food."" The other prognostic frames were reclaiming power, growing the local economy, strengthening community, fostering sustainable organizations, and networking. We did not find any motivational frames in the first round of semi-open coding. However, when we returned to reexamine the data with a hypothesis informed by our project experience beyond the textual data, we identified the motivational frame that we call recompense. Recompense suggests that those who have benefited from our current food systems should now work toward justice for those who sacrificed, usually unwillingly, to create them. This frame was mostly used indirectly and by community-based (rather than academic) partners in the project. Identifying these food justice diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames may help movement leaders to more explicitly examine and employ them and is an essential step for future research in assessing their effectiveness for creating a just, sustainable and healthy food system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>false, ""tanyakerssen""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5.

In addition to contributing to food security and food sovereignty, foraging plays a role in promoting socioecological resilience and creating communities of belonging. However, foraging is generally prohibited by regulations governing public lands in the United States and elsewhere. The growth in food forests suggests public policymakers and land managers' may be interested in reconsidering this broad prohibition of foraging but require an information base to do so. While a body of research on foraging exists, news media coverage of foraging represents an additional, readily available source of input. As a consequence, framings of foraging in media coverage likely influence managers' deliberations on this practice. The current paper uses automated content analysis to understand how the practice of gathering and consuming wild foods is framed in print and digital news media, and how these depictions have varied in a 15-year period that includes the Great Recession. Our results show that prevalent framings of foraging represent it variously as a self-provisioning practice or a source of luxury commodities and experiences, with economic uncertainty appearing to affect the frequency of each framing by news media sources.

Urban agriculture contributes to a positive environment involving food plant cultivation that includes processing, storing, distributing and composting. It is a means to increase local food production and thereby improve community health. The purpose of this study was to understand how participating in urban agriculture can help to empower young adults and build capacity for growing food in the city. Methods: This was a qualitative study of seven participants (five Indigenous and two non-Indigenous) between the ages of 19 and 29 years, engaged as interns in an urban agriculture project known as ""askiy"" in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2015. We used a case-study design and qualitative analysis to describe the participants' experience based on the sustainable livelihoods framework. Results: A collaborative approach had a great effect on the interns' experiences, notably the connections formed as they planned, planted, tended, harvested and sold the produce. Some of the interns changed their grocery shopping habits and began purchasing more vegetables and questioning where and how the vegetables were produced. All interns were eager to continue gardening next season, and some were planning to take their knowledge and skills back to their home reserves. Conclusion: Urban agriculture programs build capacity by providing skills beyond growing food. Such programs can increase local food production and improve food literacy skills, social relationships, physical activity and pride in community settings."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcela""=>true, ""jblesh""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

We explore ways to use local plants as food resources and the potential to promote food diversity and agricultural resilience. We discuss how use of local plants and the practice of local agriculture can contribute to ongoing adaptability in times of global change. Most food crops are now produced, transported, and consumed long distances from their homelands of origin. At the same time, research and practices are directed primarily at improving the productivity of a small number of existing crops that form the cornerstone of a global food economy, rather than to increasing crop diversity. The result is a loss of agro-biodiversity, leading to a food industry that is more susceptible to abiotic and biotic stressors, and more at risk of catastrophic losses. Humans cultivate only about 150 of an estimated 30,000 edible plant species worldwide, with only 30 plant species comprising the vast majority of our diets. To some extent, these practices explain the food disparity among human populations, where nearly 1 billion people suffer insufficient nutrition and 2 billion people are obese or overweight. Commercial uses of new crops and wild plants of local origin have the potential to diversify global food production and better enable local adaptation to the diverse environments humans inhabit. We discuss the advantages, obstacles, and risks of using local plants. We also describe a case study-the missed opportunity to produce pine nuts commercially in the Western United States. We discuss the potential consequences of using local pine nuts rather than importing them overseas. Finally, we provide a list of edible native plants, and synthesize the state of research concerning the potential and challenges in using them for food production. The goal of our synthesis is to support more local food production using native plants in an ecologically sustainable manner."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

A number of pro-poor organizations promote production models that include the engagement of smallholder farmers as potential enablers for employment generation, economic development and livelihood improvements. Initiatives such as this appear in Sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on food and bioenergy crops. However, the large-scale production of cash crops, such as sugarcane, also raises concerns. A critical aspect is the impact of land-use on food security, particularly if local communities are constrained in cultivating traditional crops. In this paper, we explore the relationship between a sugarcane mill and smallholder farmers in Maputo province, Mozambique. Our main goal was to investigate some key characteristics of sugarcane outgrower schemes and the implications for sustainable local development. We also complemented local findings with lessons learnt from other regions, such as Brazil. In August 2015, a field assessment examined the interplay between the sugarcane industry and local communities in southern Mozambique. We interviewed three smallholders' associations of sugarcane producers in Xinavane, together with researchers, non-governmental organizations and agricultural government bodies. Our assessment finds that the impacts of sugarcane remain somewhat unclear. Government bodies and some of the consulted NGOs claim benefits, both on income and local food production. However, these benefits are less evident to farmers. While they acknowledge labour and social services as opportunities brought by the sugar mill, progress on capacity building and irrigated areas for food production fall short of expectations. Moreover, there is also tension as to the sugarcane outgrower contract. Incomplete information seems to undermine trust from farmers who become increasingly sceptical of their contracts with the sugarcane mill, especially the payment system. Transparency, coupled with more effective food production strategies, are decisive to ensure sustainable agro-industrial development along with poverty reduction."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcela""=>true, ""jblesh""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Government initiatives were located through school feeding programmes in the different autonomous communities, their nutritional guides and representatives of the councils for education and agriculture. Non-governmental initiatives were found through their own websites and the snowball technique. Initiatives were analysed by their geographic distribution, organizational area (government vs. non government), number of school centres carrying out the initiatives, management style and organic food purchase.

In an attempt to bridge this gap, we developed a new food wellbeing approach that combines insights from food security, food sovereignty, and social wellbeing perspectives. We used the approach to frame 65 semi-structured interviews in a cluster of villages in Kaski district in the mid-hills of Nepal on various aspects of food security, agriculture, off-farm livelihood opportunities, and women's wellbeing. Our results indicate that context-specific subjective and social relational factors highlighted by the food wellbeing approach are key to understanding a paradox of increased food security, yet decreasing sustainability of small-scale agriculture. Increased levels of male out-migration and opportunities for local off-farm work have increased local capacity to purchase food. The positive consequences for food security are indicated by evidence that households with non-farm income sources had better food sufficiency, absorption capacity, nutritional quality, and stability of food supply. These off-farm employment opportunities have also led to the greater involvement of low caste groups and women in small-scale agriculture. This has been empowering for both groups and led to an increase in wellbeing, particularly for those women who have become de facto heads of household. Yet, small landholdings, persistent patterns of unequal and absentee land ownership, sharecropping, women's overwork, and the aspirations of low caste farmers and women away from agriculture are simultaneously driving the erosion of local small-scale agricultural productivity and ecological sustainability.","<p>Last updated - 2018-05-29</p>

Kedaulatan pangan emerges as a fundamentally endogenous political construct in Indonesia; that is, only marginally related to the broader global discourses of food sovereignty as espoused by organisations such as La Via Campesina. As presented by the Indonesian state, kedaulatan pangan is not oppositional to ketahanan pangan, as sometimes is portrayed elsewhere, but should instead be understood primarily as a rhetorical device to strengthen the role and function of the state and to reinforce existing associations between food security, state control, and national scale food self-sufficiency. The Indonesian notion of kedaulatan pangan responds primarily to the scalar notion of feeding the bangsa, the abstract Indonesian word for the nation'. The dominant discourse has been embraced and projected by political actors to further vested interests and also appears to be contributing to policy interventions with negative food security outcomes for some of Indonesia's most vulnerable individuals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcela""=>true, ""jblesh""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 5",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no,,

Method: A literature review and documentary analysis was undertaken. Case materials from Pacific Island countries are used to illustrate both climate change impacts and promising strategies. Results: Climate change exacerbates the existing burden of malnutrition. Food and nutrition security are affected through changes in local food production and transition from traditional nutritious diets to dependence on less nutritious imported foods, undermining efforts to reduce hunger and promote nutrition. Undernutrition, in turn, weakens climate resilience and the coping strategies of vulnerable populations. Nutrition-sensitive adaptation and mitigation measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive agriculture development, improved maternal and child care and health, and both community development and food system resilience measures are proposed as means to address the impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the agricultural vulnerability to meteorological drought in 11 stations of the Agrometeorological Station of the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA), distributed in Anzoategui, Aragua, Guarico, Lara, Merida, Miranda, Portuguesa, Tachira, Yaracuy and Zulia states of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. For this purpose, the agricultural vulnerability index (AV) was used, consisting on the average of four sub-indexes such as: land tenure fragmentation, rurality, irrigation/dry balance and agriculture intensity. Depending on the analysis of agricultural vulnerability, the seasons seem to be categorized mostly in the range of moderately vulnerable. In the case of the municipality Turen, located in the western plains, the effects of this phenomenon increased in terms of their vulnerability to socioeconomic activities and the land treatment under a capitalized agriculture integrated into the national market. For the rest of the localities, the vulnerability was linked to the social structure and productive strategies of a sector that was not integrated with the recent dynamics of agrifood systems. The contribution generated in this study represents a guiding element that stimulates the creation of a drought risk management scheme in Venezuela.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcela""=>true, ""jblesh""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 3",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no,,

The principal objective is student learning for future challenges and contributions to sustainable development of farming and food systems, including practice in acquiring capacities needed for responsible future action. The heart of the program is learning to apply ecological principles in design of farming and food systems, using multi-criteria evaluation for prioritizing sustainability challenges, and measuring exante success of transition. Working closely with farming and food system stakeholders in design and implementation of learning environment is essential, plus recognizing contributions of farmers and food system professionals as vital to education for design of future systems. Holistic approaches integrate multiple disciplines, and combine technologies developed through science with those discovered in the field. Students' prior experiences also contribute to activities in the learning landscape, and important skills are developed for autonomous and lifelong learning. Practices from organic farming and other alternative farming strategies provide useful examples, and local food systems represent one viable option that can potentially reduce food distance and food waste, and thus contribute to food security and food sovereignty. Capacities to deal with difficult challenges are developed by each student in agroecology and related courses, including observation, participation, reflection, dialogue, and visioning. These capacities are applied while completing a thesis project using natural science and social science methods that affirm their skills and prepare students well for responsible action in a complex and uncertain future.","2

We discuss the potential to improve resilience for urban-rural regions by enhancing food production as part of multifunctional land use.

Arable farming has been declining since 2000 in all three areas due to urban expansion and recreational land use changes. In city plans, networks of protected areas and green spaces and their importance for human wellbeing have been acknowledged. Policies for farmland preservation in peri-urban settings exist, but strategies for local food production are not expressed in present planning documents. Among the diversity of peri-urban agricultural activities, peri-urban food production is a developing issue. However, the competing forms of land use and the continuing high dependence of urban food on global food systems and related resource flows reduces peri-urban food production and improvements in urban food security.

Ethnoagroforestry is a research approach that provides a theoretical framework integrating socio-ecological disciplines and TEK. We analyze in this study general types of Agroforestry Systems of Mexico, in which peasants, small agriculturalist, and indigenous people are the main drivers of AFS and planning of landscape diversity use. We analyzed the actual and potential contribution of ethnoagroforestry for maintaining diversity of wild and domesticated plants and animals, ecosystems, and landscapes, hypothesizing that ethnoagroforestry management forms may be the basis for food sufficiency and sovereignty in Mexican communities, regions and the whole nation. Methods: We conducted research and systematization of information on Mexican AFS, traditional agriculture, and topics related to food sovereignty from August 2011 to May 2015. We constructed the database Ethnoagroforestry based on information from our own studies, other databases, Mexican and international specialized journals in agroforestry and ethnoecology, catalogues and libraries of universities and research centers, online information, and unpublished theses. We analyzed through descriptive statistical approaches information on agroforestry systems of Mexico including 148 reports on use of plants and 44 reports on use of animals. Results: Maize, beans, squashes and chili peppers are staple Mesoamerican food and principal crops in ethnoagroforestry systems practiced by 21 cultural groups throughout Mexico (19 indigenous people) We recorded on average 121 +/- 108 (SD) wild and domesticated plant species, 55 +/- 27% (SD) of them being native species; 44 +/- 23% of the plant species recorded provide food, some of them having also medicinal, firewood and fodder uses. A total of 684 animal species has been recorded (17 domestic and 667 wild species), mainly used as food (34%). Conclusions: Ethnoagroforestry an emergent research approach aspiring to establish bases for integrate forestry and agricultural diversity, soil, water, and cultural richness.

In the 1990' s, many studies argued that local food production is stimulated by urbanization; this is not the case anymore and most researches focus on the issue of import dependency. In this study, we aim at identifying the main structures of food consumption in 15 west and central African countries. Based on 36 national household consumption surveys in these countries, we show that cities are not so heavily dependent on imports as usually assumed. First, although imported wheat and rice are dominant in starchy products consumed by city dwellers, we show that local starchy products (maize, cassava, sorghum, and to a lesser extent yam and plantain) are still heavily consumed. Second, starchy products represent only one third of the urban food consumption, in economic value. Animal products (another third of urban food consumption) and sauce products (vegetables, legume, oils, sugar and condiments) plus fruits and beverages (the last third) are mainly locally sourced. Such a finding reveals that urban food market is able to lead the development of local food chains. Given that calorie inputs are less and less important limiting factors for nutrition in the region under study, and that over-consumption of calories is often combined to micro-nutrients deficiency, we conclude that food policies must take into account all food products (instead of cereals only), and in particular those which contribute to diet diversification."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

The policies which enabled this growth reversed decades of previous policy prioritising national food production and rural development. Other consequences have included corporatisation and neoliberalisation' of agriculture and widespread agrarian distress' manifesting most dramatically in epidemic levels of farmer suicides. One of the few exceptions to this pattern has been the foothills of the Himalayas, where agriculture has been relatively insulated from these changes and food sovereignty has remained largely in the hands of local communities.

At the same time, global food systems experience a new wave focusing on local foods and food sovereignty featuring high quality food products of verifiable geographical origin. This article argues that Geographical Indications (GI's) hold the potential to help transform the Tanzanian agriculture-dependent economy through the tapping of value from unique products, attributing taste and colour to place or regional geography. This study aims to identify the existence and characteristics of food origin products in Tanzania that have potential for GI certification. The hypothesis was that there are origin products in Tanzania whose unique characteristics are linked to the area of production. Geographical indications can be useful policy instruments contributing to food security and sovereignty and quality within an efficient marketing system with the availability of government support, hence the need to identify key candidates for GI certification. Five Tanzanian origin products were selected from 14 candidate agricultural products through a scoping study. Rice from Kyela, Aloe vera, Coffee and Sugar from Kilimanjaro and Cloves from Zanzibar are some of the product cases investigated and provides for in-depth case study, as 'landscape' products incorporating 'taste of place'. Interviews were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Data was collected on the production area, product quality perceived by the consumer in terms of taste, flavour, texture, aroma, appearance (colour, size) and perceptions of links between geography related factors (soil, land weather characteristics) and product qualities. A qualitative case study analysis was done for each of the (five) selected Tanzanian origin products investigated with plausible prospects for Tanzania to leapfrog into exports of Geographical Indications products. Framework conditions for producers creating or capturing market value as stewards of cultural and landscape values, environments, and institutional requirements for such creation or capturing to happen, including presence of export opportunities, are discussed. Geographical indication is believed to allow smallholders to create employment and build monetary value, while stewarding local food cultures and natural environments and resources, and increasing the diversity of supply of natural and unique quality products and so contribute to enhanced food security."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

The paper begins by identifying two key drivers of food security: household incomes (on the demand side) and nutrition-sensitive, 'fair food' agriculture (on the supply side). We focus on this second driver and argue that healthy populations require an agricultural sector that delivers dietary diversity via a fair and sustainable food system. In order to understand why nutrition-sensitive, fair food agriculture is not flourishing in Australia we introduce the development economics theory of urban bias. According to this theory, governments support capital intensive rather than labour intensive agriculture in order to deliver cheap food alongside the transfer of public revenues gained from rural agriculture to urban infrastructure, where the majority of the voting public resides. We chart the unfolding of the Urban Bias across the twentieth century and its consolidation through neo-liberal orthodoxy, and argue that agricultural policies do little to sustain, let alone revitalize, rural and regional Australia. We conclude that by observing food system dynamics through a re-spatialized lens, Urban Bias Theory is valuable in highlighting rural-urban socio-economic and political economy tensions, particularly regarding food system sustainability. It also sheds light on the cultural economy tensions for alternative food networks as they move beyond niche markets to simultaneously support urban food security and sustainable rural livelihoods.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

These contribute to processes of social differentiation and class formation, creating rural communities more complex and antagonistic than those sketched in food sovereignty discourse and neo-populist claims of peasant egalitarianism, cooperation and solidarity. Proponents of food sovereignty need to address gender systematically, as a strategic element of its construct and not only as a mobilising ideology.

To highlight the failings of the approach, we present findings from the Soils, Food and Healthy Communities Initiative in northern Malawi, which has demonstrated success in combatting malnutrition through a combination of agroecological farming practices, community mobilization, women's empowerment and changes in intrahousehold gender dynamics.

While the state is home to some of the richest soil in the world and abundant fresh water sources, the flat topography has made industrial agriculture the norm. A monoculture primarily of food for stock feed and ethanol production has resulted in environmental degradation, inequitable labour practices and food insecurity. Universities can engage in helping communities generate sustainable economies based on healthy food systems by helping identify barriers to smaller acreage production, processing and distribution. More importantly, universities can help develop a regional narrative that recalls a history of local food production as well as identifying regional resources to be used in innovative local agriculture initiatives of the future building an economy of scale."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

The transformation from a diet based on products gathered, fished, hunted, planted or even purchased locally for a ""supermarket diet"", indicates the passage of a traditional diet to a more modern diet. This transformation is an interesting indicator of modernization processes. The analysis of these changes allows us to understand diverse processes such as urbanization and its effects on social organization and the individual. Eating habits in Brazil, are somewhere between the ""traditional"" way of obtaining food and a ""supermarket diet"", which varies from region to region. The theme of food supply in the Amazon should be examined as a matter comprising the demand and supply of food in the cities and the factors that shape the urban network. Referring to demands, we have a process of ongoing urbanization with a strong financial component explained in various social development policies that quickly transform the eating habits of the population. Regarding supply, there is the fact that rural production in the Amazon does not meet the demand of cities. Amazonas State, in Brazil, is heavily dependent on foreign production. This dependence and the fact that access to most of the cities in the state is mainly by boat involves a complex supply network. This network is strongly defined by the hydrological cycle. This article brought new elements to the understanding of economic and alimentary dynamics in the tri-border Brazil-Peru-Colombia, looking at flows of food and local production and their importance in the supply of cities in the region. We conclude that in the context of strong hydrologic vulnerability, to understand the structures of urban supply networks and local production is essential to think about ways of promoting food sovereignty in the region with heavy reliance on food produced outside the region and the lowest levels of social development in Brazil. The results are not conclusive, but strongly indicate the need to innovate both in research and in the frontier areas of urbaneconomic geography, and its interface with the geography of supply and health."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,Developing,

Central American activists nonetheless appropriated and redefined it in the late 1980s. Advocates typically suggest that 'food sovereignty' is diametrically opposed to 'food security', but historically there actually has been considerable slippage and overlap between these concepts. Food sovereignty theory has usually failed to indicate whether the 'sovereign' is the nation, region or locality, or 'the people'. This lack of specificity about the sovereign feeds a reluctance to think concretely about the regulatory mechanisms necessary to consolidate and enforce food sovereignty, particularly limitations on long-distance and international trade and on firm and farm size. Several regulatory possibilities are mentioned and found wanting.

An alternative vision defended by the food sovereignty movement is that long-term food security cannot rely on dependency on food imports, but must be built on the development of domestic production with enough barrier protection to shelter it from world price fluctuations and unfair trading. The purpose of this paper is to look into whether the West African nations can achieve food sovereignty given their various trade commitments and other external constraints. The particularity of our approach is to combine a historical economic analysis with a political approach to food sovereignty and trade commitments. Our results suggest that external brakes on the development of food sovereignty policies are marginal, as the countries still have unused room for manoeuvre to protect their smallholder agriculture under the terms of draft World Trade Organization agreements and Economic Partnership Agreements and under the international financial institutions' recommendations. Rather the international environment seems to be instrumented by West African states that do not manage to secure a national political consensus to drive structural reforms deemed vital and further the food security of the urban populations over the marginalized rural populations. Recently, the regional integration process has made headway with a common agricultural support and protection policy project that could herald an internal political balance more conducive to food-producing agriculture.

This statistic, as well as a revised figure of a 70% increase by 2050, have been widely used by key individuals in the food policy arena and have come to play a significant role in framing current UK and international policy debates about food security and the future direction of global agriculture. This paper provides a critique of the specific claim that we need to increase global food production by 70-100% in order to feed the world in 2050 and challenges the dominant framing of the problem of food security in the UK, and its resolution. This critique is based on two main observations: firstly, increasing production on such a scale was never intended as a normative goal of policy and, secondly, to do so would exacerbate many of the existing problems with the current global food system. This clearly raises questions about why these statistics have risen to such prominence. Drawing on framing and discourse as conceptual tools, this paper shows how these statistics are a key discursive device used by dominant institutions and individuals with prior ideological commitments to a particular framing of the food security issue. This paper discusses the social movement activities and institutional scientific and political challenges to this, that are beginning to coalesce and articulate an alternative set of discourses around concepts of ecological food provision, food sovereignty, and agroecology.

Developing effective policies and programs at the city or neighborhood level demands as a first step the accurate mapping of existing urban agriculture sites. Mapping efforts in major U.S. cities have been limited in their focus and methodology. Focusing on public sites of food production, such as community gardens, they have overlooked the actual and potential contribution of private spaces, including home food gardens, to local food systems. This paper describes a case study of urban agriculture in Chicago which used the manual analysis of high-resolution aerial images in Google Earth in conjunction with ArcGIS to identify and map public and private spaces of food production. The resulting spatial dataset demonstrates that urban agriculture is an extensive land use type with wide variations in the distribution of sites across the city. Only 13% of sites reported to be community gardening projects by nongovernment organizations and government agencies were determined, through image analysis, to be sites of food production. The production area of home gardens identified by the study is almost threefold that of community gardens. Study results suggest opportunities may exist for scaling up existing production networks including home food gardens and enhancing community food sovereignty by leveraging local knowledges of urban agriculture.

We first define Diversified Farming Systems (DFS) as farming practices and landscapes that intentionally include functional biodiversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales in order to maintain ecosystem services that provide critical inputs to agriculture, such as soil fertility, pest and disease control, water use efficiency, and pollination. We explore to what extent DFS overlap or are differentiated from existing concepts such as sustainable, multifunctional, organic or ecoagriculture. DFS are components of social-ecological systems that depend on certain combinations of traditional and contemporary knowledge, cultures, practices, and governance structures. Further, as ecosystem services are generated and regenerated within a DFS, the resulting social benefits in turn support the maintenance of the DFS, enhancing its ability to provision these services sustainably. We explore how social institutions, particularly alternative agri-food networks and agrarian movements, may serve to promote DFS approaches, but note that such networks and movements have other primary goals and are not always explicitly connected to the environmental and agroecological concerns embodied within the DFS concept. We examine global trends in agriculture to investigate to what extent industrialized forms of agriculture are replacing former DFS, assess the current and potential contributions of DFS to food security, food sovereignty and the global food supply, and determine where and under what circumstances DFS are expanding rather than contracting."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

The resulting scalar tensions demonstrate the potentially contradictory alignment of geopolitics and geoeconomics within processes of globalization and neoliberalization. This article examines the geopolitical and geoeconomic place of hunger and the hungry through a critical analysis of the food-for-work (FFW) approach to combating hunger. FFW programs distribute food aid in exchange for labor and have long been used to plan and deliver food aid. Although debate continues as to whether and under what conditions FFW programs are socially and economically just, governments, international institutions, and nongovernmental organizations tout them as a flexible and efficient way to deliver targeted aid, promote community development, and improve long-term prospects for economic development and food security. In the period since 11 September 2001, FFW programs are also cited as effective deterrents to terrorist recruitment strategies, and development and food security more broadly have been incorporated into national security strategies, especially but not only in the United States. The FFW approach attempts to resolve the scalar contradictions of hunger through the imposition of a labor requirement that disciplines the threat of the hungry while enforcing global connection. Case studies of FFW programs in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Indonesia illustrate this contradiction and highlight the development and possible future of approaches to hunger under neoliberal geopolitics."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

The natural resource base is one of the many factors affecting food security. Its variability and decline creates problems for local food production. In this study we characterize for sub-Saharan Africa vegetation phenology and assess variability and trends of phenological indicators based on NDVI time series from 1982 to 2006. We focus on cumulated NDVI over the season (cumNDVI) which is a proxy for net primary productivity. Results are aggregated at the level of major farming systems, while determining also spatial variability within farming systems. High temporal variability of cumNDVI occurs in semiarid and subhumid regions. The results show a large area of positive cumNDVI trends between Senegal and South Sudan. These correspond to positive CRU rainfall trends found and relate to recovery after the 1980's droughts. We find significant negative cumNDVI trends near the south-coast of West Africa (Guinea coast) and in Tanzania. For each farming system, causes of change and variability are discussed based on available literature (Appendix A). Although food security comprises more than the local natural resource base, our results can perform an input for food security analysis by identifying zones of high variability or downward trends. Farming systems are found to be a useful level of analysis.

However within regional development debates that prioritize utilising the waters of the Mekong to generate electricity, capture fisheries are often presented as ultimately doomed, and therefore as an unfortunate, but necessary trade-off for hydropower. At the heart of these debates, lie contested definitions of development. The notion that fisheries could or should be traded-off for some other form of development exemplifies this tension. This paper draws on anthropological approaches to policy analysis based on discourse and narratives. We begin by placing the conventional wisdom regarding the place of fisheries in regional development under closer scrutiny. We then explore the potential for a counter narrative based around food and food sovereignty, in which fisheries and fishers are drivers, rather than costs of development. We argue that fisheries provide a range of livelihood and developmental values that cannot be replaced and that their management continues to hold potential for strengthening independence and self-reliance. In doing so, we build on empirical evidence from the Lao PDR, a country with a rich capture fishery but also endemic food crises, and also a national policy commitment to both poverty reduction and extensive large-scale hydropower development. As such, this paper attempts to reframe the debate on development in the Mekong. The paper has wider significance for considering how a broader focus on food and food producers can generate alternative development pathways. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Global seafood production is dominated by modern day hunter-gatherers and so food sovereignty debates until recently have been confined to terrestrial systems. The recent introduction and subsequent spectacular proliferation of industrial marine aquaculture has brought the food sovereignty debate to the sea. The current hub of North American marine-based industrial aquaculture is British Columbia (BC) where salmon farming has grown to become a major factor in shaping coastal communities. Since its introduction into BC in the mid-1980s, the global industrial salmon farming industry has changed dramatically. The meteoric rise of farm salmon production exported from Norway, Chile, and Scotland has caused global salmon prices to plummet, forcing intense industry-wide rationalization. This is typically characterized by large multinationals cannibalizing smaller producers in order to establish economies of scale to counterbalance market price erosion of their product. As a result, global market forces have all but eliminated the sovereignty of both BC salmon farmers and salmon fishermen. Salmon farmers and fishermen-and their communities-must adopt ever-greater economies of scale to remain competitive with growing/consolidating foreign farm producers. All ecological issues associated with farms (organic wastes, parasites, toxins use, escapes etc.) are density dependant and therefore escalation of production results in incrementally greater ecological impacts. Further, the (d-)evolution of salmon from a culturally iconic seasonal delicacy and cultural keystone species of indigenous communities to a low-value global commodity has manifested a broad array of impacts highlighting the codependence of ecology, culture, and economics in coastal communities. Finally, increasing production increases supply, which in turn lowers price and alters consumer expectations of price/value relationships. This not only forces another round of production increases/consolidation on the farm, but also drives out commercial fishermen, particularly smaller owner/operators, who have no capacity to adopt economies of scale in the face of falling salmon prices. The ensuing rationalization process results in corporate fleets, the only model capable of adapting to the economic realities of the commoditization of salmon.

The process included a global encounter with the landless peoples in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the La Via Campesina conferences, and the global fora in Valencia and Porto Alegre. La Via Campesina has been developing a new concept of agrarian reform that recognizes the socio-environmental aspects of land, the sea and natural resources, in the context of food sovereignty. Integral agrarian reform encompasses policies of redistribution, just, equitable access and control of natural, social and productive resources (credit, appropriate technologies, health, education, social security etc.) by peasants and their families, indigenous people, landless workers, artisanal fisherfolk, pastoralists, the unemployed, Dalit communities, Afrodescendents and other rural peoples. It is argued that development policies should be based on agro-ecological strategies centred on family and peasant agriculture and artisanal fishing; trade policies that oppose dumping of products in the market and favour peasant and family farm production oriented towards local, national and international markets; and public policies in the areas of education, health and infrastructure for the countryside that complement trade and other policies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Cuban peasants have been able to boost food production without scarce and expensive imported agricultural chemicals by first substituting more ecological inputs for the no longer available imports, and then by making a transition to more agroecologically integrated and diverse farming systems. This was possible not so much because appropriate alternatives were made available, but rather because of the Campesino-a-Campesino (CAC) social process methodology that the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) used to build a grassroots agroecology movement. This paper was produced in a 'self-study' process spearheaded by ANAP and La Via Campesina, the international agrarian movement of which ANAP is a member. In it we document and analyze the history of the Campesino-to-Campesino Agroecology Movement (MACAC), and the significantly increased contribution of peasants to national food production in Cuba that was brought about, at least in part, due to this movement. Our key findings are (i) the spread of agroecology was rapid and successful largely due to the social process methodology and social movement dynamics, (ii) farming practices evolved over time and contributed to significantly increased relative and absolute production by the peasant sector, and (iii) those practices resulted in additional benefits including resilience to climate change."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

A series of severe weather-related events in 2009 damaged the economy, costing more than twice the national budget for agriculture that year. In 2010, rice imports reached an all-time high, making the Philippines the biggest rice importing country in the world that year. There are 94 million Filipinos today - 4 million more than in 2008. The population is expected to continue to grow by about 2 million a year. The domestic food chain (from farm to table) is under great pressure, corroded by years of neglect. Changes in the use of agricultural land, the degradation of ecosystems and the impacts of climate change are increasing the food production burden on agricultural communities in the Philippines. These challenges have together made the Philippines more vulnerable to global food price volatility. This report examines the issues confounding the Philippine food system and sets out recommendations for a new agricultural future in which Filipinos have enough to eat, always. Key recommendations include: public and private spending on smallholder agriculture must increase to levels that can unleash the productive potential of farming and coastal communities; public spending and policy innovations must be put in place to ensure that climate change adaptation programs are crafted early and implemented for, with, and by vulnerable communities; social protection programmes must be developed to strengthen the role of women in villages and the market; and the conversion of productive agricultural lands for purposes other than food production should cease."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Food Sovereignty, a food system model spearheaded by La Via Campesina and other rural social movements around the globe, represents a unique opportunity to address the vulnerability of national food systems. Thanks to its mass organizations and popular participation in national policy, Cuba is one of the few countries with the capacity to implement food sovereignty, which could help it minimize the threats posed by food price fluctuation, extreme climatic events - the island experienced three catastrophic hurricanes in 2008 alone - and the persistent U.S. hostility towards its national project. The advance of food sovereignty in Cuba, as elsewhere, requires a profound commitment to the principles of agroecology, a heightened appreciation for smallholder farmer participation in increasing food production, and the possibility to design, manage and implement such a model at the national level. Guided by the principles of agroecology, and with the express aim of advancing the struggle for food sovereignty, researchers at the Universidad Central de Las Villas (UCLV) in Villa Clara province, Cuba are developing indicators of food sovereignty for practical use at the smallholder farm level."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

The dry bean seed is a natural source of protein and carbohydrates, is also rich in vitamin B such as niacin, folic acid and thiamine, provides iron, copper, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium, and contains high fiber content. There exist many classes of beans that are characterized by their seed size, color, shape and the type of plant growth. It is considered that in total there are 70 species in the genus, and at least 50 in Mexico; five species have been domesticated Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common bean), Phaseolus coccineus L.

This region faces numerous social and physical challenges simply by nature of the size of the islands, and their geographical isolation. The 21st century, however, has brought new challenges from climate change to increasing food prices to the alarming increase in lifestyle-related diseases, which is strongly associated with the over-consumption of nutritionally poor foods, often imported. The response to the increasing food prices has been to strengthen local food production. Increasing local food production and promoting local food consumption provides an excellent opportunity to address the nutrition-related health problems. However, local food production has to be sustained in the light of climate change. This paper describes the work of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) in promoting and supporting the conservation and utilization of root and tuber diversity, as one of the solutions to manage these many challenges.

""Canasta"" means ""basket"", and represents the basic food share that all citizens should have the right to access. The most impressive aspect of this movement is its grassroots-based origin: a movement born from necessity. In a country where national and local governments consistently fail to deliver food security measures, the canastas comunitarias provide a social safety net for marginalised populations. Essentially, the canastas comunitarias are urban consumer groups formed by neighbourhood ties or linked through churches, clubs or universities. Members of a canasta comunitaria can gain access to healthier food at lower costs through their community organizations. Ecuador is the seventeenth most biodiverse country in the world, home to over 80 native potato varieties. Despite this, the diet of the local population is based on rice, one potato variety ('Superchola'), wheat, corn, and is supplemented with processed foods. Through wholesale buying, the canasta comunitaria affords poor urban families with more nutritious options. As the canastas comunitarias increasingly save on their food purchases, consumers are beginning to wonder where their food comes from. Through farm visits, group members learn about the realities of agroecological farming. As the canastas comunitarias gain momentum, diverse projects have been proposed for building local economies around environmentally sound production. A priority of this movement is to increase consumer awareness about the origin of food in order to create a mutually beneficial farm-to-city market system. Consumer-based proposals include nutrition workshops and cooking classes, farm visits and exchange programmes, and educational fairs. Equally, small-scale producers must identify strategies for organised production and commercialization in order to meet new demands, in both quantity of production and quality. Nationally, the canastas comunitarias subscribe to wider social and political networks, such as the Colectivo Agroecologico. They have also become active in nationwide campaigns to promote affordable and healthy food systems. A unique opportunity for including the urban and rural poor in an otherwise exclusive market has been created by the canastas comunitarias, and over time their effort has become articulated as part of an international ""food sovereignty"" movement."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Their food security, poverty levels and rural development are strongly affected by changes on world food markets. A case in point is Senegal's strong dependency on imports of broken rice. These imports, which have been fostered by export and industrialization strategies, urban bias politics and vested interests, and which have changed food habits profoundly, have hampered and still hamper local food production of both rice and other food grains. In Senegal the political and economic scope to protect farmers is limited and it is questionable if supply can respond adequately to price signals.

Typically conducted by women, retirees, and other reserve labour, this local food production has provided a measure of autonomy from the vagaries of inefficient production and food distribution and from high food prices, compounded by unemployment. However, the yields and safety of local foods are sometimes poor in regions with severe pollution, particularly in household food production from contaminated landscapes in and near urban and industrialized areas. Urban food sustainability ultimately must reflect a local determination of food needs, which, among other things, reflects experience with local complications of environmental health. In such cases, the goal of local food security may incorporate non-local strategies. The case study from Gliwice in the Upper Silesia region of southwest Poland discusses (1) organizing an acquisition, labelling, and distribution system for retailing chemically tested organic products, linking farmers to consumers; (2) distributing chemically tested produce directly to schools and hospitals and creating subsidies for their purchase; and (3) educating community groups about food contamination and the benefits of organic foods and farming."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Before 1994, the Food Control Law (1942) had regulated the production and distribution of rice. Its main purpose was to ensure stability in the supply, demand, and price of rice. Two major events in 1993, namely, acceptance of the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and the unprecedented poor rice harvest, led to a review of the rice control system. A report prepared in 1994 by the Agricultural Policy Council offered the following recommendations: (1) the government should continue rice production control by encouraging the voluntary participation of farmers' organizations; (2) a rice reserve system should be incorporated into a new rice management system; (3) the imported rice under the minimum access provision should be dealt with by the Food Agency; (4) voluntarily marketed rice should be the major emphasis on distribution; and (5) rice producers should be given more diversified opportunities to sell their products. The new law implemented these recommendations. It is concluded that although the rice reserve system was set up to be prepared for rice shortage, the measures for dealing with bumper harvests are not not sufficient. A situation of potential oversupply is expected in the near future and a more strengthened production adjustment programme will be necessary."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Agriculture accounts for over 50% of GDP and employs about 70% of the labour force. Subsistence agriculture is traditional in Samoa with families farming plots of communally owned land. Cash cropping has become increasingly important however, and subsistence farming alone is now non-existent. Three major agricultural products, coconuts, cocoa and taro are cultivated. Copra products and cocoa bean, accounting for 40% of all exports, are the main exports. Production of taro has been steadily increasing. Coffee, groundnuts, bananas, pineapples and other tropical fruits are grown mainly for domestic consumption. The government is now anxious to diversify agricultural production away from copra and cocoa to include bananas, taro, other crops and animal feed products. Pigs and poultry are the main livestock, and cattle raising is being developed. A strain is being placed on Samoa's food supplies by the growing population compounded by a decline in the productive work force, due to emigration. As a result, food imports are increasing in order to fill the gap between local food production and food demand. Per caput calorie and protein availability have been steadily increasing and in 1985 stood at 2473 Kcals and 63.1 g respectively. The traditional Western Samoan diet is based on starch roots and fruits such as taro, breadfruit. The contemporary diet is a mixture of traditional and Western foods. Early childhood undernutrition is in evidence and, initially more common in rural areas, malnutrition has increasingly become an urban problem."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""Nicholas""=>false, ""mfeldman""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type",>true,2,>false,1,in,old,no,no,,

Both crop and livestock production registered vigorous growth rates. Although increases in food production were significant in 1985, the region is experiencing a low level of self sufficiency as a whole. Food production has been lagging behind demand and the cost of food imports has been increasing. Agriculture as in other parts of the developing world, is facing many problems and constraints. Most countries in the region have designed and implemented policies and programmes to increase local food production and some successes have been achieved, but the results are below expectations.

Food and nutrition security should be the framework for both national development policies of recipient countries and supporting activities of the donors. In ideal circumstances the developing countries should establish their own food and nutrition security strategies, covering food production, marketing/distribution, final consumption and, if feasible, the establishment of a strategic grain reserve. From most recent research it is evident that the effects of food aid on local food production depend more on the individual market and price policy of the recipient country, on their distribution system and on their use of any counterpart funds, than on pure market effects. The marketing and distribution system also influences whether needy target groups can be reached. Donors of food aid should therefore change their criteria for aid, consider the national food and nutrition security policy of the recipient country, and integrate their food deliveries into long-term development programmes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no,,

While these events centred on the major grain trading nations, they exposed serious weaknesses in the food situation of developing countries. The establishment of orderly national and, if possible, international grain stock policies has been widely accepted as one major action measure deserving attention. FAO's International Undertaking on World Food Security, adhered to by 50 countries, contains specific guidelines for such stock policies. Current food stock policies in developing countries are generally very weak. Although sizeable food stocks are already influenced by government agencies, such stocks do not usually make up a critical proportion of total food supply and, in effect, form at most a safety margin to cover unforeseen current requirements. On the basis of the first seven FAO surveys of national food security policies and action plans, it is tentatively concluded that progress could best be achieved if developing countries would establish specific programmes for stock building, covering a medium term period. Priority action will not only concern stocks but will first of all require more adequate domestic food information systems and the establishment of preparedness plans to cover any food emergencies. Actual stock targets could be moderate, provided private food stocks are monitored and central control is exercised on grain imports and exports. It is essential that food stock policies be used to encourage local food production, in the context of supply stabilization."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no,,

One is the African Green Revolution model, implemented by a consortium of partners comprised of African governments, the private sector, philanthropic donors, and multilateral institutions. The other is the food sovereignty model, headed by Africa's peasant unions and civil society organizations. This paper examines how the ontological backgrounds of these two agrarian models inevitably inform and influence their respective approaches to food security and sustainability in Sub-Saharan Africa. On one hand, the African Green Revolution favors modern rationalist notions of economic structural transformation and agricultural development. On the other hand, food sovereignty is inspired by historical structural ideas rooted in sociology that tackle issues of power and (in) justice embedded within global political and economic institutions. These diametrically opposed ideological foundations help to explain the polarization and tensions that exist between the two agrarian models. Such tensions, however, also hinder fruitful discussion about how to effectively address key concerns in food and agricultural systems. In response, this paper draws insights from sustainability assessment literature to propose a framework comprised of key sustainable food system indicators that are important for merging food security and sustainability goals in southern Africa."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

On the one hand, alternative food movements actively seek to reach broader decision-making spheres. On the other hand, public authorities and private actors increasingly refer to such notions to guide or justify their action. The article questions the impacts of these trends from two main perspectives: their effect on the power relations between actors; and their transformative potential, that is their capacity to alter a sectorial frame of reference driven by market and multi-functionality logics. The demonstration relies on a case study located in Geneva, Switzerland, concerned with the development of the regional brand Geneve Region - Terre Avenir (GRTA). This case is interesting for three reasons: the close (and explicit) link to urban agriculture and food sovereignty, the collaborative forms of governance that have been developed in a country where the agro-food sector has long been considered as strongly corporatist, and the criteria of guarantee (quality, proximity, traceability and fairness) that distinguish GRTA from comparable brands. These singularities are explored through a cognitive approach, which considers change as the result of a confrontation between communities of actors whose belief systems diverge. Throughout the case study, compromises and imbalances between communities are highlighted.

Government initiatives were located through school feeding programmes in the different autonomous communities, their nutritional guides and representatives of the councils for education and agriculture. Non-governmental initiatives were found through their own websites and the snowball technique. Initiatives were analysed by their geographic distribution, organizational area (government vs. non-government), number of school centres carrying out the initiatives, management style and organic food purchase. A descriptive analysis of the data was carried out. Results: 12 initiatives carried out by 318 schools (2.16% of all the schools with food service in Spain) were identified.

FSv263,,,,Making local food work: the challenges and opportunities of today's small farmers.,"Janssen, B. and Janssen, B.",2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When it comes to local food, it takes more than ""knowing your farmer"". This book takes on some of the myths about how the local food system works and what it needs to thrive. Advocates claim that small biodiverse farms will fundamentally change farming, rural communities, and the American diet. For many, simply by knowing our farmers we become champions of a new way of eating that revolutionizes our economy and society. But that argument ignores the fact that if local food is to succeed, it requires many of the trappings of conventional food production, including processors, middlemen, inspectors, and regulators. By listening to and working alongside people trying to build a local food system in Iowa, the author uncovers the complex realities of making it work. Although the state is better known for its vast fields of conventionally grown corn and soybeans, it has long boasted a robust network of small, diverse farms, community supported agriculture (CSA) enterprises, and farmers' markets. The book asks how Iowa's small farmers and CSA owners deal with farmers' market regulations, neighbors who spray pesticides on crops or lawns, and sanitary regulations on meat processing and milk production. How can they meet the needs of large buyers like school districts? Who does the hard work of planting, weeding, harvesting, and processing? Is local food production benefitting rural communities as much as advocates claim? It is argued that we can make local food systems work, but we have to do more than shop at our local farmers' market to make it happen.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

Food sovereignty and the associated ability of people to participate in the production, distribution and consumption decisions of their food have been at the fringe of this discussion. Linked with this is the debate on the question of pursuing policies of food self-sufficiency or policies of self-reliance where food imports are considered a natural extension of food security. Examining the elements of food security through the food system participation framework of food sovereignty is an opportunity worthy of further exploration. This paper seeks to add a dimension to the understanding of food security by considering the value that a food sovereignty perspective has on the right to access food that is nutritious and safe for consumption. Current themes are cited and reviewed, and the implications of both food security and food sovereignty perspectives for the food system are argued. Agricultural trade liberalisation has benefited some societies and harmed others. To this end, the Global Strategic Framework (the Framework) on Food Security and Nutrition has recently incorporated the philosophy of the food sovereignty movement into its guidelines. The Framework provides an opportunity to view food security through a lens of food sovereignty providing guidance for all societies on how to safeguard their food security."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

A historical lens allows us to understand the social structures and institutions that condition the politics of food over time and the ways in which the agency of relevant state and societal actors has been, and continues to be, enhanced and exercised, or not, in the political contestation over the food system. A relational lens allows us to capture the process-oriented nature of food sovereignty - the ways in which the very meanings and attempted practices of food sovereignty are being dynamically and contentiously shaped and reshaped over time. An interactive lens allows us to analyze how actors within the state and in society are dialectically linked, molding the construction of food sovereignty through their interactions. Rather than an enquiry into food sovereignty per se, this piece is about efforts toward food sovereignty, partly to address a tendency in the literature and political debates to conflate the two. This is thus an investigation into food sovereignty construction, meaning how food sovereignty is being articulated and attempted, as well as contested - including resisted, refracted or reversed - in a given setting. The case of Venezuela is examined as one of a growing number of countries where food sovereignty has been adopted into state policy and among the longest-running experiments in its attempted construction. Concluding reflections are shared on the extent to which the HRI framework can help us understand the current conjunctural crisis facing Venezuela's food system, and implications for food sovereignty research and activism more broadly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5.

Fresh water is an even more precious commodity than oil today as this is seen as a rapidly diminishing resource through over use of aquifers with scarce and unpredictable rainfall not replenishing the needs of these countries which increasing rely on reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination of seawater but at a cost in terms of energy. Recycling of waste water and sewage is carried out and used to water urban landscaping and some crops, but there are risks of the presence of pathogens. Much food today is imported to satisfy the requirements of expanding populations, especially foreign workers on temporary visas who make up more than half the residents in many of these Gulf States. Despite limited published data on Gulf States regarding enteric and foodborne diseases and their prevention and control, profiles emerge that can describe the current situation and some future directions. Gastrointestinal diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, and amebic dysentery can be brought into these countries through workers returning from endemic regions, and also through refugees from conflict-torn neighboring countries. However, some diseases are endemic like brucellosis and fatal illnesses from the newly identified Middle East Respiratory Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) associated with camels. In the 1990s, coalition troops stationed during the Gulf War brought in external suppliers and caterers, but using local products like chickens with troops occasionally suffering from infections. The hot climate, particularly in summer, can allow rapid growth of pathogens in foods, especially where refrigeration is not available as in home-prepared lunches by workers and during transportation of foods across traffic-congested cities. One of the biggest concerns for Saudi Arabia is the health oversight of millions during the annual Hajj, and despite much care over restriction of infected pilgrims and care of food, occasional outbreaks have been reported. Government agencies are particularly concerned about restaurant food and try and follow up on complaints of customers but rarely are agents identified; those that have include Salmonella, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Implicated foods include ethnic products such as Turkish menu items and shawarma. Local culture may play a role in allowing growth of pathogens such as serving women after men at weddings. However, deaths that have been attributed to microbial sources may have been caused by illegal use of pesticides such as aluminum phosphide. Severe penalties have been applied to owners and staff implicated in outbreaks including fines, jail sentences and deportations, which are not typical of Western nations. However, some agencies have initiatives to help educate and train foreign workers in several languages. Foodborne disease surveillance systems are generally not adequate though some countries have initiated modernization of inspection approaches and laboratories. Consumer surveys show that residents have some knowledge of foodborne disease but this could be improved especially for women who do most of the shopping and food preparation in homes. Agencies are increasing directing campaigns for general food safety in their populations, and as long as resources are available, food control is likely to improve over time in Gulf States which is good news for visitors, expatriate workers and citizens alike.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>false, ""Hannah""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4.

Each of the nine essays describes Hawai'i's foodscapes and collectively makes the case that food is a focal point for public policy making, social activism, and cultural mobilization. With its rich case studies, the volume aims to further debate on the agrofood system and extends the discussion of food problems in Hawai'i. Given the island geography, high dependency on imported food has often been portrayed as the primary challenge in Hawai'i, and the traditional response has been localized food production. The book argues, however, that aspects such as differentiated access, the history of colonization, and the neoliberalized nature of the economy also need to be considered for the right transformation of our food system. The essays point out the diversity of food challenges that Hawai'i faces. They include controversies over land use policies, a gendered and racialized farming population, benefits and costs of biotechnology, stratified access to nutritious foods, as well as ensuring the economic viability of farms. Defying the reductive approach that looks only at calories or tonnage of food produced and consumed as indicators of a sound food system, Food and Power in Hawai'i shows how food problems are necessarily layered with other sociocultural and economic problems, and uses food democracy as the guiding framework. By linking the debate on food explicitly to the issues of power and democracy, each contributor seeks to reframe a discourse, previously focused on increasing the volume of locally grown food or protecting farms, into the broader objectives of ecological sustainability and economic viability."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

We analyze here the possible effects of local crises by developing a new propagation model, parsimonious but grounded on data-based and statistically-verified assumptions, whose effectiveness is proved on the Argentinean crisis in 2008-09. The model serves as the basis to propose indicators of crisis impact and country vulnerability to external food-production crises, which highlight that countries with largest water resources have the highest impact on the international trade, and that not only water-scarce but also wealthy and globalized countries are among the most vulnerable to external crises. The temporal analysis reveals that global average vulnerability has increased over time and that stronger effects of crises are now found in countries with low food (and water) availability."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Three case studies were conducted on local farmers adaptation strategies across two regions identified with production systems subject to very different institutional and agro-ecological settings, but equally considered highly vulnerable to climate change. Complex implications are expected for the maintenance of food production in the traditionally agriculture based regions, with subsequent socio-economic effects. 1. Horticultural production: Due to strict regulations regarding chemical treatment, conventional and organic farmers who generally have limited possibilities to avoid infested sites are dependent on innovative measures for crop adaptation and soil treatment. 2. Large-scale organic farms: Production sites are facing decreased crop yields due to deficiencies in nitrogen supply due to low of farmyard manure and decrease of microbial nitrogen mineralization exacerbated by increasing pre-summer droughts. 3. Agro-pastoral systems: Small ruminants production systems are managing environmental constraints by reducing overall flock size, reducing the movement to grazing sites and decreasing feed supplements. Herders are also diversifying their sources of income. Comparative analysis is conducted across case studies. Research questions address the role of local farmers knowledge in contributing to requisite variety in local food production systems, existing measures for diversification at the farm level and provisions in case of failure in existing regional and national strategies.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

A.",2015,DISSERTATION,Grey literature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This thesis combines contemporary ethnography and political history in a sociological exploration of the ontology of food sovereignty in Ecuador. It argues that in countries like Ecuador, food networks that do not establish an ontological difference between 'nature' and 'culture' promote food sovereignty in practice as long as agricultural and science and technology (S&T) policies enable the autonomous development of such networks. It shows that, in fact, the lupine (Lupino mutabilis) food networks in the Andean highlands have traditionally functioned in a rhizomatic way, without establishing hierarchies between entities, like foods as goods or foods as gifts, do not prioritize society over nature, and have, moreover, expanded without discontinuities between urban and rural areas. This analysis shows that these networks can promote food sovereignty, because in them is condensed an ontology that is distinct from that of modernity with regard to the cultivation, processing and consumption of food. Considering these findings, the rationality of S&T policies (specifically those related to plant breeding) and the current policies of the Ecuadorian State (including the recent translation of the Via Campesino food sovereignty proposal into the Ecuadorian Constitution) is analysed. It is argued that such policies go against the logic of food networks. Food sovereignty is an achievable goal if Ecuadorian government policies contribute to the strengthening of food networks, creating new links so that they can sidestep the agribusiness model.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Marcela""=>true, ""jblesh""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 5",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no,,

The paper differentiates local food systems by examining character, method and scale and illustrates how local food systems rarely meet the ideal type of either food sovereignty or the capitalist industrial model. In order to address five forms of distance inherent in the global industrial food system, localisation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for food sovereignty.

In following the rationale of investment in agro-ecological theory and practice, the paper next argues that the reconstruction of 'big push theory' outside the 'modernisation' paradigm that once produced it is possible, and that formulation and discussion of big push strategies could reclaim a space within critical agrarian studies. Big push theory offers a frame for the consistent critique of 'silver bullet' development projects through the study of negative feedback loops; and a frame for the study of positive feedback loops, which crucially underlie the proposals of food sovereignty movements for broad, integrated changes in agrarian systems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

Domestic production covers 70% of net domestic consumption. A vast and efficient food reserve scheme insures against import disruptions. Nonetheless, the food security contribution by the four sectoral policies involved is mutually constrained: our agriculture is protected by the world's highest tariffs. Huge subsidies, surface payments, and some production quotas substitute market signals with rent maximisation. Moreover, these inefficiencies also prevent trade and investment policies which would keep markets open, development policies which would provide African farmers with the tools to become more competitive, and supply policies which would work against speculators. The paralysing effect of Swiss agricultural policies is exacerbated by new ""food security subsidies"" in the name of ""food sovereignty"" while two pending people's initiatives might yet increase the splendid isolation which in effect reduce Swiss farmer competitiveness and global food security. Is there a solution? Absent a successful conclusion of the Doha Round (WTO) or a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement (TTIP) further market openings and a consequent ""recoupling"" of taxpayer support to public goods production remain highly un-likely.

One of the humanity's significant achievements has been to produce adequate food for the largest growing population. However, the co-existence of chronic hunger and malnutrition with presence of adequate capacities to address it is one of the gravest paradoxes of our time. In one-third of African countries the average daily calorie intake remains below the recommended level of 2100 kcal. The need and importance for greater food sovereignty has emerged out of broader concerns over the negative impact of world's food system on food security and environmental sustainability. Adoption of the food sovereignty principles are essential to empower local communities to have greater control over their productive resources, use and sustain ecologically friendly means of production, and access local markets as well as nutritious and culturally accepted food. The majority of African farmers are smallholders. However, the existing trend of land grabbing in Africa seriously affects food sovereignty in an unprecedented level. Based on the secondary sources, this paper explores different dimensions of the complex relationship between food sovereignty and land grabbing in African countries. It also analyses the various aspects on how the ongoing process of land grabbing in Africa affects food sovereignty which in turn leads to food insecurity of millions. The introduction of intensive agricultural production, due to land grabbing often based on a transformation of complex farming systems for commercial purpose can seriously threaten biodiversity.

A brief history of Maori food systems is necessary as context-their adaptation from Polynesia to New Zealand and later, to European settlement.

While the described phenomena have undoubtedly contributed to a widespread decline in soil productivity of the vast marginal agro-pastoral millet and sorghum based land use systems, a few, largely overlooked, innovations have allowed enhancing productivity across a range of agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions. These are worthwhile to analyse in order to better understand how the well-known constraints to farmers' investments in more sustainable agro-pastoral production systems can be overcome. Successful innovations such as the locally made 'charette', a donkey-drawn, single axe farm transport vehicle, and the counter-season cultivation and regional marketing of onion have transformed subsistence agriculture in Niger since the 1970s. More recently the use of small amounts of seed-placed mineral phosphorus fertilizer (propagated as 'microdosing' by NGOs, FAO and the Gates Foundation) in millet and sorghum, a sprawling use of urban and periurban land for the highly intensive production of vegetables, specialty crops and sometimes also milk, as well as the fattening of small ruminants for religious festivals provide opportunities to effectively strengthen poor people's livelihood strategies and enhance their food sovereignty, often without involvement of extension services. The factors which seem to determine the success of such approaches are (i) their capacity to enhance farmers' access to markets (secure sales and cash earning), (ii) the possibility to adopt an innovation with only small amounts of capital (low entrance fee), and (iii) limited risk of failure despite high rainfall variability (safe return on investment). These factors add to the recent spread of real-time information about consumer demands and prices for agricultural goods across the region which is largely the result of the mobile phone revolution in Africa."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

There has been a strong bias in national agricultural development policy towards the production of rice as staple food in Indonesia. Local food crops have been neglected in the agricultural development policy in the last 50 years, leading to the dependency on imported commodities and creating a vulnerability in the national food security. This paper aims at assessing the factors constraining local food production in Indonesia based on empirical experiences drawn from a research in Kulon Progo Regency, Yogyakarta Province. The government of Kulon Progo Regency has declared its commitment in the development of local food commodities as a part of its agricultural development policy, as it is mentioned in the long-term and medium-term development planning documents. There is also a head regency decree mandating the use of local food commodities in any official events organized by the government organisations. The research shows that there are at least six policy-related problems and nine technical factors constraining local food crops production in the regency. Some of the policy-related and structural factors hampering the production of local food crops consist of (1) long-term policy biases towards rice, (2) strong biases on rice diet in the community, (3) difficulties in linking policy to practices, (4) lack of information on availability of local food crops across the regency and (5) external threat from the readily available instant food on local market and (6) past contra-productive policy to the production of local food crops. The technical factors constraining local food production comprises (1) inferiority of the food stuff versus the instantly prepared food, (2) difficulty in preparation and risk of contagion of some crops, lack of technology for processing, (3) continuity of supply (some crops are seasonally available), (4) low production and productivity level and (5) lack of knowledge on production and processing, (6) lack of skills and knowledge among the young people to grow the crops, (7) higher price as a result of commodity scarcity in the market, (8) attitudes towards local food commodities as secondary products, and (9) bias of information in marketing whereas local market is very small."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

In this scenario, countries around the world, especially developing countries where the pervasiveness of hunger and food scarcity is more acute, are resorting to various counter strategies to meet the growing demand and to avert food insecurity and famine. Over the recent years there has been growing interest to strengthen and intensify local food production in order to mitigate the adverse effect of global food shocks and food price volatilities. Consequently, there is much attention towards home gardens as a strategy to enhance household food security and nutrition. Home gardens are an integral part of local food systems and the agricultural landscape of developing countries all over the world and have endured the test of time. Through a rigorous literature review, this paper first examines definitions and characteristics of home gardens and then provides a global review of their social, economic, and environmental contributions to communities in various socio-economic contexts. Many of the compositions on home gardens share research and experiences of developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These studies recognize positive impacts of home gardens towards addressing food insecurity and malnutrition as well as providing additional benefits such as income and livelihood opportunities for resource-poor families and delivering a number of ecosystem services. However, only a handful of case studies were found on post-crisis settings. While providing a general overview of some of these studies, this review investigates the home garden experiences of post-conflict Sri Lanka, where home gardening has been practiced for centuries. While emphasizing multiple benefits, we also highlight constraints to home garden food production.

In this paper we explore the concept of food sovereignty in relation to the current development of the European food systems with special emphasis on social food networks, and agricultural learning network building. Food sovereignty is often discussed in the Global South, e.g. Latin America, where the concept developed in strong popular movements. Which lessons can we learn from others, e.g. the so-called 'developing countries'? Danish and French cases will represent and contrast food system policies and social food and farmer networks in the North-Western European context. Based on this, we will discuss the special opportunities and challenges for reaching food sovereignty considering the current globalised world, challenged by financial and environmental crisis. Our agriculture has generally become increasingly industrialized and food systems increasingly controlled by major companies. This influences how feed and food is transported, stored, traded, consumed and wasted. Complex knowledge (including traditional) about agricultural systems and social relations in agriculture and food gets lost. The Common Agrarian Policies (CAP) influences the development of local alternatives farming systems and national food sovereignty. We will discuss the potential role and tendencies of alternative farming and food systems (e.g. organic, mixed farming with agro-ecological basis) based on cases where consumer-farmer networks increase common knowledge about food production, act and interact collectively for local social and political change by building food systems over which they as local communities can take ownership and control.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>false, ""Nicholas""=>true, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5.

The ability of social economy enterprises to adddress systemic crises, their importance in promoting employment, especially for youth and women, as well as their impact on the income of poorest populations, convinced the Malian government of the merits of creating a framework to encourage their development. Moreover, the obligation to guarantee food sovereignty and security, especially within the context of demographic challenges, climate change and repetitive food crises, has led the government to promote agricultural as a key element of its national strategy. It remains clear, however, that in order to ensure the sustainability of these measures, they must be supported by national policies co-created by the State and the various other actors.

In this article, we present an exploratory case that presents findings from research looking at the private emergency food system of a rural county in northern New England, U.S. Specifically, we examine the history of this national network to contextualize our findings and then discuss possibilities for collaboration between this private system and the local food movement (on behalf of both the public and the state). These collaborations present an opportunity in the short term to improve access to high quality local foods for insecure populations, and in the long term to challenge the systemic income and race-based inequalities that increasingly define the modern food system and are the result of prioritizing market-based reforms that re-create inequality at the local and regional levels.

The major impacts on agriculture from climate change are due to the pattern of rainfall and increased temperature. The increased temperature, in the longer term, has negative impact on crop yield through increased rate of respiration and evapo-transpiration process causing moisture deficit in the soil and plant system due to more emission of green house gases. Under changing precipitation trends, water harvesting is crucial to facilitate water availability. An integration of agriculture with forest, agro-forestry, can be effective to mobilize local capacities in relation to climate regulation. It is indeed necessary to formulate an integrated action plan for agricultural development in which adaptation strategies are embedded within the local spatial planning in consideration of economic, social and political context. The best adaptation measure to secure against climate change is to promote the principles and practices of sustainable agricultural technology among all farmers from marginalized to capitalized ones. More importantly, the promotional technologies of sustainable soil management, ecological practices of pest management, and participatory promotion of local varieties or landraces are the major adaptive mechanism to revive our agriculture from the impacts of climate change. Such practices are helpful to promote the concept of food sovereignty, which is utterly important in the developing countries like Nepal, rather than food security."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,

This has spawned a new research agenda under the moniker of ""food justice."" In this article, we contend that food justice research can benefit from employing the ""environmental inequality formation"" approach outlined by Pellow, which argues that environmental inequalities are the product of historical processes which involve multiple stakeholders with varied motives. Most importantly for this article, however, is his contention that these inequalities need to be addressed via a life cycle approach. We take this directive literally, and employ a cradle to the grave approach to food justice, or what we call the food cycle. This approach highlights how food inequalities occur in different ways and rates at different stages in the human life cycle. Here we focus on the very beginning of the food cycle by exploring breastfeeding and the food consumed by our most vulnerable population, infants. The case of breastfeeding helps to expand our understanding of food justice by unpacking some of the structural impediments that play a role in the disproportionately low rates of breastfeeding among women of color and the working classes. We conclude that elucidating food inequalities as they pertain to race, class, gender, and age will only increase the vitality of the field and can catalyze necessary changes to ensure food justice for all populations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true}",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no,,

This trend has been reflected in the development of a variety of alternative food networks and short food supply chain initiatives. In Czechia, the local and good-quality movement has been significantly represented by the boom in farmers' markets during the past 2 years. The aim of this paper is to examine the actual potential of the Czech agricultural sector to supply the recently developed network of farmers' markets. Even though these markets are generally considered to offer farmers better revenues than selling their products to big processors and retail companies, many Czech farmers' market managers face a lack of potential vendors for their markets. Therefore, we ask if there are producers and self-processors of goods typically sold on farmers' markets of the appropriate size and legal form in suitable locations in relation to the areas of the biggest demand. The quantitative approach applied was based on the national statistical data on the agricultural sector. It was used to develop a set of indicators which have been displayed in maps and further examined. The results show a high theoretical potential of the Czech agricultural sector to supply farmers' markets because there are relatively many small farmers producing products sellable on farmers' markets. In the Czech context, where the tradition of running independent businesses was interrupted by the country's communist past, the lack of experience with private entrepreneurship and marketing among farmers seems to be the main obstacle to broader involvement of farmers on farmers' markets.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

The impact of food hubs on the region's evolving food system, however, is contradictory. At the same time that food hubs further the development of local food supply chains and create market opportunities for farms, they can also run contrary to the bigger and longer-term goals of the local food movement. In this viewpoint article, we look critically at the role of nonprofit food hubs in efforts to build local food systems. Speaking from our experiences in the local food movement in western North Carolina and drawing from social movements and food systems scholarship, we argue that food hubs, when used as primary mechanisms of local food system building, can deprive the movement of its capacity to activate broad participation in the food system. We argue that efforts to build local food systems need a foundation of work that engages people (such as farmers, citizens, people who work in the food industry) in processes that can shape the practices, values, and impacts of systems of food production and distribution. While they can mitigate the mismatch between the smaller scale typical of local food and larger mainstream markets, food hubs alone cannot challenge industry norms and practices, and they can even aid the food industry in maintaining the status quo.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

An increasing reliance on imported food products has not only affected the health of Pacific communities, but also threatened food security, as shown with the recent global food price crisis. Climate change further emphasizes the challenges to food security through its impact on food production, human health, infrastructure, national food sovereignty, and the ability of households to purchase food. To face these challenges, members of the Pacific Plant Genetic Resources Network (PAPGREN) met in 2009 to address the following constraints which specifically impact on the development of local agriculture: (1) lack of information/documentation on traditional crop species in the Pacific; (2) no regional priority list of traditional crop species; (3) lack of policy support from various government agencies; (4) poor awareness at all levels about the value and potential of underutilized species. A regional strategy on ""crops for the future"" in the Pacific based on underutilized plant species was developed containing the following key elements: 1. generation and collection of knowledge/ research; 2. communication and dissemination; 3. policy advocacy; 4. market development; 5. partnerships; 6. capacity building and institutional strengthening.

This paper describes the path toward building a new governance framework for     the provision of public policies that initiated a virtuous cycle for the progressive     elimination of hunger and poverty. However, it is important to emphasize that     the country continues to be characterized by dynamics that generate inequalities     and threaten social and environmental justice.     2.The paper explains how Brazil has sought to find original solutions to eliminate     hunger and poverty, imposing on the State the obligation to implement public     policies that guarantee the fundamental rights of the human being: the right to     minimum income, food, health, education and work. The document is addressed     to people and organizations interested in learning about the strategies that the     country has been adopting to ensure food and nutrition security and sovereignty     as well as the human right to adequate food.     3. The country’s redemocratization process, which started in the mid-1980s, was     instrumental in forging the current relations between the State and civil society.     The 1988 Constitution guaranteed social, civil and political rights that forced the     Brazilian State to recognize the need to reorganize its structure and governance     in order to fulfill its new obligations. Moreover, the 1988 Constitution ensured     new forms of participation in public policies through councils and social control     policies, while enabling partnerships between the public sector and the nonprofit     private sector. A new arena for social dialogue has been established.     | 7 |     4. It was evident that the necessary changes to public institutions transcended     the boundaries of administrative and financial reform, requiring a more     comprehensive reformulation and expanding of the concepts of the various     government sectors and their corresponding action. Civil society has always been     present and played a leading role in this process of reconstruction and expansion     of public institutions, with a view to ensuring the newly achieved rights.     5.The systemic approach was the option of various sectors, possibly because it     facilitates the regulation of inter-federative coordination - federal, state and     municipal - and inter-sectoral management, where the roles and responsibilities     of each can be clearly defined and the autonomy of each federative entity     preserved. The adoption of a “national system” for the provision of public policies     was also in tune with the national trend of understanding the various sectors of     society in an inter-dependent and indivisible way. For Brazilians the concept of     food and nutrition security, in its broadest sense, is the result of the realization     of the right to food (regular and permanent access to adequate food for all) in     the conditions under which food is produced and sold, without compromising     other rights such as housing, health, education, income, environment, labor,     transportation, employment, leisure, freedom, and land access and tenure.     6.The Zero Hunger Project was originally conceived in 2001 by a nonprofit civil     society organization interested in contributing to the formulation of a National     Food and Nutrition Security policy that was still lacking in the country. The project,     which was adopted by Lula´s administration in 2003, defined the fight against     hunger and poverty as a political priority and paved the way for the development     of legal instruments that would ensure the continuity of policies and programs     targeted at the poor. In 2006, the Organic Law on Food Security (LOSAN) created     the National Food and Nutrition Security System (SISAN), with the aim to     guarantee and protect the human right to adequate food. It is important to note     that LOSAN has a strong human rights approach, placing human dignity and     empowerment at the core of discussions on public policy and strengthening     relations between governments and civil society. It also launched the basis for     the Constitution to include the right to food in the list of other social rights     which had already been secured, and which finally happened in 2010.     7. The mandate of the National Food and Nutrition Security System (SISAN) is to     organize and strengthen the institutions of the Brazilian State and create formal     spaces for social participation through Food and Nutrition Security Councils     (CONSEA) in designing, influencing and monitoring public policies in the field     | 8 |     of food and nutrition security and sovereignty. This paper presents the modus     operandi and inter-relations between the governance system forums and civil     society participation. It also presents the legal instruments that make up the     reference framework governing the human right to adequate food in Brazil.     8. Some of the key lessons learned from this historic process include: (i) the     importance of participatory pacts related to concepts and principles; (ii) the     appropriateness of the choice of a systemic and intersectoral approach as a     way to guarantee the human right to adequate food and promote food and     nutrition security; (iii) the relevant role of civil society ensured through formal     spaces of social dialogue (CONSEAs); (iv) the importance of the State putting     the protection of human rights above market interests; (v) the necessary practice     of intersectoral coordination in the design and management of public policies     on food and nutrition security; (vi) the strategic role of women in the struggle     to guarantee food sovereignty as well as the conservation and sustainable     management of natural resources; and (vii) the respect for and guarantee of     ethno-development principles in the design and implementation of public     policies for indigenous peoples, blacks, traditional peoples and communities.     9. Despite the undeniable progress made, many challenges still remain on the     Brazilian development agenda. The existing social inequality is incompatible     with the country’s current level of economic development. The number of     socially vulnerable people is still high, and they have no access to all the public     programs to which they are entitled. Moreover, there is a recurring effort from     conservative sectors to weaken and criminalize the social movements and     organizations fighting for social and environmental justice, which threatens to     undermine Brazilian democracy.     10. The paper concludes that the progress made by Brazil in the fight against     hunger and poverty resulted from the combination of the interests of     government and civil society through a process of collective, participatory and     democratic construction. The continuity of the main public policies that have     contributed to this progress and the convergence of political and social forces     are indispensable conditions to overcoming the challenges that still hinder the     elimination of all forms of social inequality and violation of rights."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no,,
