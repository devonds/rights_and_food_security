The article develops the idea of collective, rights based emancipation by focusing on the practices of two related social movements, the Landless Workers Movement (MST) and la Via Campesina. The MST and Via Campesina seek to replace existing rights to 'food security' with a human right to 'food sovereignty'. While food security agendas emphasise the role of international governance agencies in providing food on behalf of others, food sovereignty is secured by peasant social movements themselves. Furthermore, practices of active citizenship and democratic organisational structures, built through the grassroots and transnational struggles through which peasants raise their demand for human rights, are vital in enacting rights to food sovereignty. In instances where victims are not entirely silenced and powerless, this combination of a demand for human rights and the development of practices of citizenship that enable people to demand and secure rights for themselves provides a contextually grounded emancipatory alternative to interventionist politics that, however well intentioned, risk reinforcing the dependence of purportedly powerless victims."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>false, “Barbara""=>true “Devon""=>true}",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no

Social participation has been at the heart of structural changes achieved since then.

Food policies in Mexico are characterized by reflecting the international pattern of the food security approach, linked to the new global agro-food system, in which poverty and food insecurity constitute an opportunity for the corporate food regime that limits access to food to millions of people. It is concluded that food security in Mexico has been limited to social policies to combat poverty, devoid of recognition that it is a structural problem of asymmetric economic development, so despite government efforts, poverty and food insecurity have not been reversed.

In February 2007, over 600 civil society representatives came together at the International Forum on Food Sovereignty in Selingue, a village in the Malian countryside. The debates resulted in a strong declaration on the concept of food sovereignty. The definition of food sovereignty closely resembles existing international human rights standards, thus, the potential of human rights to offer important protective mechanisms is discovered or rediscovered. According to the country's 2007 Population Report, about 31% of the Uganda population still lives in extreme poverty and hunger. Overall access to adequate food in Uganda and the whole of Africa relies heavily on the work of women to produce 80% of the food. And yet, women are second rate in most Ugandan cultures. So while women are among the first victims of violations of the right to food, they are also the key to its realization. As a country receiving FAO support, Uganda is a pioneer in establishing a framework law on the right to food that will ensure policy coherence. Based on these achievements in the national legal framework, a network of NGOs and Civil Society Organizations has started to apply the Voluntary Guidelines to monitor the Ugandan government's activities in fighting hunger and malnutrition and to hold the state accountable for violations of the right to food. The government has announced corrective measures for the protection of small-scale farmers - a political and legal achievement of working with human rights."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true}",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no

We sought to understand the state of knowledge on relationships  between health equity--i.e. health inequalities that are socially produced--and food systems, where the concepts of 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' are prominent. We undertook exploratory scoping and mapping stages of a 'meta-narrative synthesis' on pathways from global food systems to health equity  outcomes. The review was oriented by a conceptual framework delineating eight pathways to health (in)equity through the food system: 1--Multi-Scalar Environmental, Social Context; 2--Occupational Exposures; 3--Environmental Change; 4--Traditional Livelihoods, Cultural Continuity; 5--Intake of Contaminants; 6--Nutrition; 7--Social Determinants of Health and 8--Political, Economic and Regulatory context. The terms 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' were, respectively, paired with a series of health equity-related terms. Combinations of health equity and food security (1414 citations) greatly outnumbered pairings with food sovereignty (18 citations). Prominent crosscutting themes that were observed included climate change, biotechnology, gender, racialization, indigeneity, poverty, citizenship and HIV as well as institutional barriers to reducing health inequities in the food system. The literature indicates that food sovereignty-based approaches to health in specific contexts,  such as advancing healthy school food systems, promoting soil fertility, gender equity and nutrition, and addressing structural racism, can complement the longer-term socio-political restructuring processes that health equity requires.  Our conceptual model offers a useful starting point for identifying interventions with strong potential to promote health equity. A research agenda to explore project-based interventions in the food system along these pathways can support the identification of ways to strengthen both food sovereignty and health equity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nicholas""=>false, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: possible framing paper | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the different effects of such measures on the health and dietary outcomes of female coffee and  food small holder farmers in Uganda. METHODS: We gathered evidence through a cross-sectional comparative interview survey of 190 female coffee producers and 191 female food producers in Ntungamo district. The study mostly employed quantitative methods of data collection, targeting the sampled households. We also utilized qualitative data; collected three months after the household survey data had been collected and their analysis had been accomplished. Using qualitative interviews based on an unstructured interview guide, extra qualitative information was collected from key informants at national, district and community levels. This was among other underlying principles to avoid relying on snapshot information earlier collected at household level in order to draw valid and compelling conclusions from the study. We used indicators of production, income, access to food and dietary patterns, women's health and health care. Of the two groups selected from the same area, female coffee producers represented a higher level of integration into liberalised export markets. RESULTS: Document review suggests that, although Uganda's economy grew in the period, the household economic and social gains after the liberalization measures may have been less than expected. In the survey carried out, both food and coffee producers were similarly poor, involved in small-scale production, and of a similar age and education level. Coffee producers had greater land and livestock ownership, greater access to inputs and higher levels of income and used a wider variety of markets than food producers, but they had to work longer  hours to obtain these economic returns, and spent more cash on health care and food from commercial sources. Their health outcomes were similar to those of the  food producers, but with poorer dietary outcomes and greater food stress. CONCLUSIONS: The small-scale women farmers who are producing food cannot rely on  the economic infrastructure to give them support for meaningful levels of production. However, despite having higher incomes than their food producing counterparts, the evidence showed that women who are producing coffee in Uganda as an export commodity cannot rely on the income from their crops to guarantee their health and nutritional wellbeing, and that the income advantage gained in coffee-producing households has not translated into consistently better health or food security outcomes. Both groups have limited levels of autonomy and control to address these problems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no

METHODS: Multi-stage stratified sampling was used to select 749 farming households living in three coffee producing sub-districts of Jimma zone, Ethiopia. Domains of women's Autonomy were measured by a tool adapted from demographic health survey. A model for determination of paternal involvement in childcare was employed. Caring practices were assessed through the WHO Infant and young child feeding practice core indicators. Length and weight measurements were taken in duplicate using standard techniques. Data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 21. A multivariable linear regression was used to predict weight  for height Z-scores and length for age Z-scores after adjusting for various factors. RESULTS: The mean (sd) scores of weight for age (WAZ), height for age (HAZ), weight for height (WHZ) and BMI for age (BAZ) was -0.52(1.26), -0.73(1.43), -0.13(1.34) and -0.1(1.39) respectively. The results of multi variable linear regression analyses showed that WHZ scores of children of mothers who had autonomy of conducting big purchase were higher by 0.42 compared to children's whose mothers had not. In addition, a child whose father was involved  in childcare and feeding had higher HAZ score by 0.1. Regarding age, as for every month increase in age of child, a 0.04 point decrease in HAZ score and a 0.01 point decrease in WHZ were noted. Similarly, a child living in food insecure households had lower HAZ score by 0.29 compared to child of food secured households. As family size increased by a person a WHZ score of a child is decreased by 0.08. WHZ and HAZ scores of male child was found lower by 0.25 and 0.38 respectively compared to a female child of same age.

Starchy staple foods dominate the diets in these settings. This places the population, especially women of reproductive age, at a risk of micronutrients deficiencies. This study seeks to examine the association between women's decision-making autonomy and women's achievement of higher dietary diversity (DD) and determine the socio-demographic  factors that can independently predict women's attainment of higher DD. METHODS:  The study used data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. The participants comprised of 2262 women aged 15-49 years and who have complete dietary data. The DD score was derived from a 24-h recall of intake of foods from nine groups. The score was dichotomized into lower DD (DD </=4) and higher (DD >/=5). Logistic regression was used to assess the association between women decision-making autonomy (final say on how to spend money, making household purchases, own health care, opinions on wife-beating, and sexual intercourse with husband) and the achievement of higher DD. The logistic regression models were adjusted for covariates at the individual and household levels. RESULTS: The analysis showed that women participation in decision-making regarding household purchases was significantly associated with higher DD, after adjusting for individual and household level covariates. The odds of achieving higher DD were higher among women who had a say in deciding household purchases, compared to women who did not have a say (OR = 1.74, 95 % CI = 1.24, 2.42). Women who had more than primary education were 1.6 times more likely to achieve higher DD, compared to those with no education (95 % CI = 1.12, 2.20). Compared to women who lived in polygamous households, those who lived in monogamous households had higher odds of achieving higher DD (OR = 1.42, 95 % CI = 1.04, 1.93). CONCLUSIONS: Net other covariates, women who have a say in making household purchases are more likely to achieve higher DD compare to those who do not have a say.

In 2005, the Japanese government introduced the Basic Law of Shokuiku (food and nutrition education) to promote national food self-sufficiency, improve public health, and preserve local culinary culture through domestic food consumption. This paper argues that the campaign attempts to advance both governmental and public interests in food sovereignty by constructing common images of Japanese diets and nostalgia for rural agriculture; along the way it attempts to increase a sense of solidarity between urban consumers and rural producers. Nevertheless, the campaign focuses on consumer's food literacy, thus framing food sovereignty as responsibilities of people, and diverts public attention from structural issues embedded within the nation's food system, including national dependence on other countries for food security, as well as the marginal economic status of rural agriculture. Simultaneously, the feeling of nostalgia for rural agriculture remains, expanding an imaginary of food sovereignty among some urban consumers. Drawing on an investigation of policy discourses and in-depth interviews with young adult consumers in urban Japan, this paper examines how the notion of food sovereignty and Japanese diets have been constructed and advanced through the nationwide Shokuiku campaign. The decade-long campaign has evolved to become an agent of social control of urban consumer food consumption rather than helping consumers to play a role in establishing a system underpinned by food sovereignty as an alternative to the industrial present."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true}",>true,4,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no

The present paper reviews food security issues as they pertain to indigenous communities, particularly in northern Manitoba, and describes community and government approaches to tackling food insecurity. Method: A narrative review was formed drawing on international literature and Canadian research and practice. Results: Strategies such as those described above have the potential to significantly enhance access to affordable, nutritious food in Northern Communities thereby improving food security, healthy living and preventing chronic disease. Conclusions: Community-based action combined with structural changes and a supportive policy environment hold out the prospect of changing the conditions of food access that underlie the ultimate success of healthy living and chronic disease prevention efforts.

The premise is twofold: close-grained appreciation of already-interacting biophysical processes allows for the design of complementary social and agricultural systems requiring minimum energy inputs. Secondly, the insistence on campesino smallholders as actors in the design of sustainable food systems directly addresses decades of ""top-down"" developmental interventions, from Green Revolution experiments in the 1960s and 1970s to international food security programmes in the 1990s. Permaculture connects food insecurity to the delegitimisation of smallholder innovation and insists that, through sharing simple techniques, campesino farmers can contribute towards future-oriented questions of environmental sustainability. This repositioning is brought about through the mobilisation of pedagogical techniques that legitimise the experiences and expertise of small-scale farmers, while standardising experimental methods for testing, evaluating and sharing agroecological practices. Like food sovereignty and food justice movements, Salvadoran permaculture links hunger with longer histories of (uneven) capital accumulation and dispossession and renders campesino farmers its protagonists. By modelling a form of expertise premised in intimate involvement with specific environments, permaculture goes still further, seeking to dislodge a pervasive knowledge politics that situates some as knowers and innovators, and others as passive recipients. This grounds human rights in an ethos of caring for the ""more-than-human"" world and places emphasis on a corollary right as part of food justice, increasingly being demanded ""from below"": the right to know.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""jblesh""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: 5",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no

Analysis characterized food insecurity experiences and conditions that challenge and enable food security with attention to traditional food systems, relationships to land, and gender-related responsibilities. Findings show that communal responsibilities generate resilient strategies that provide for all in times of crisis, and long-term food insecurity is managed through social programs, organized charities, and family support. Enhancing food security involves healing and protecting a limited land-base for food production, integrating food production with community priorities for education, training, health, economic development, and scientific innovation.

METHODS: This study assessed the feasibility, sustainability and efficacy of the VSP by surveying 93 customers and interviewing 14 programmatic stakeholders who had recently used the VSP or been involved with  program design and implementation. RESULTS: We identified the following themes: The VSP addressed transportation barriers and food availability. The VSP impacted customers and the city by including improving food purchasing behavior, creating  a food justice ""brand for the city"", and fostering a sense of community. Customers appreciated using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to pay for groceries, but policy changes are needed allow online processing of SNAP benefits. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation summarizes lessons learned and serves as a guide to other public health leaders interested in developing similar programs.

We found that maternal intrahousehold autonomy on child feeding was substantial. However, this autonomy was lost for a period of time while in close contact with the healthcare staff. The authority of the healthcare workers was at its peak when the child was born and faded gradually as the child grew. Building maternal competence is important for child-feeding outcomes, but our data showed that the health education methods used by the healthcare workers were inadequate to improve maternal to improve the motivation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate principal's perceptions on barriers  to healthy dietary choice among pupils within a socio-ecological framework. Focus groups (n = 11) were carried out with school principals and staff (n = 55) in two rural districts of Sri Lanka. Principals identified a number of barriers to healthy dietary choice by students, which could be found at a number of levels of influence of a socio-ecological framework: (i) structural level barriers included educational and agricultural policies, (ii) living and working level barriers included employment opportunities and local food production, (iii) social and community level barriers included traditions and social/cultural beliefs and (iv) individual level barriers included knowledge and preference. Findings from this study suggest that the barriers to healthy dietary choice amongst secondary school students in Sri Lanka occur at many levels supporting the use of multifactorial programmes to promote healthy eating.

This study was directed by a developing theory of maternal capabilities that posits that the impact of health-directed interventions may be  limited by unmeasured and poorly understood maternal characteristics. Ugandan caregivers defined three major life events that constrain women's capabilities for childcare: early pregnancy, close child spacing, and polygamous marriage. Women describe major constraints in their decision-making capabilities generally  and specifically to procuring food for young children. Future nutrition programs  may improve their impact through activities that model household decision-making  scenarios, and that strengthen women's social support networks. Findings suggest  that efforts to transform gender norms may be one additional way to improve nutrition outcomes in communities with a generally low status of women relative to men. The willingness of younger fathers to challenge traditional gender norms  suggests an opportunity in this context for continued work to strengthen resources for children's nutritional care. SIGNIFICANCE: Maternal factors such as autonomy are associated with child feeding practices and nutritional status, with varying degrees depending on the definition of maternal-level constructs and context. This study describes the events and processes that constrain maternal capabilities-intrapersonal factors that shape mother's abilities to leverage resources to provide care to children-as they relate to nutrition and hygiene practices. We report community beliefs and understandings about which capabilities have meaning for child nutrition and hygiene, and develop a conceptual framework to describe how these capabilities are formed and describe implications for future nutrition programs in East Africa and similar settings."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Barbara""=>true, “tanyakerssen”=>false, “Devon”=>true}",>true,2,>false,1,in,ok,yes,no

Several studies in diverse areas worldwide have pointed out the importance of wild food plants (WFPs) for assuring food sovereignty and food security, and therefore the current study was aimed at documenting traditional knowledge of WFPs and analyzing how this varies among generations. METHODS: Ethnobotanical data were collected during 2010-2012. In total of seventy-two informants were interviewed in ten villages via in-depth interviews and group discussions with key informants followed by freelisting. Data were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics and novelty was checked by comparing the gathered data with the published literature. RESULTS: A total of fifty-one WFP species belonging to twenty-eight families were documented. Rosaceae was the dominant family with the largest number of species and highest frequency of citation (FC). July was the peak month for availability of WFPs, and fruit was the most commonly consumed part. Among the most cited species, Olea ferrugenia was ranked first with a FC = 1, followed by Amaranthus spinosus (FC =  0.93). Of the documented species about 14 % (7) were marketable and 27 % (14) were reported for the first time to be used as WFP species in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: WFPs still play an important role in the food and culture of the study area and the folk knowledge attached to them is remarkable in the region, although declining among the younger generations. The recorded species needs to be re-evaluated in local projects aimed at fostering endogenous strategies of food security, as well as re-evaluating cultural heritage and sustaining small-scale food market circuits.","<p>Last updated - 2018-06-13</p>

Human health is an implied component of this definition through the principle of healthy food. In fact, improved human health is commonly cited as a benefit of transforming food production away from the dominant practices of industrial agriculture. Yet, does the use of ""ecologically sound and sustainable methods"" of food production necessarily translate into better human health outcomes? Does greater choice in defining an agricultural or food system create gains in health  and well-being? We elucidate the conceptual linkages between food sovereignty and human health, critically examine the empirical evidence supporting or refuting these linkages, and identify research gaps and key priorities for the food sovereignty-human health research agenda. Five domains of food sovereignty are discussed including: (1) use of agroecological management practices for food production, (2) the localization of food production and consumption, (3) promotion of social justice and equity, (4) valuation of traditional knowledge, and (5) the transformation of economic and political institutions and structures  to support self-determination. We find that although there are many plausible linkages between food sovereignty and human health, the empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that increasing food sovereignty yields improvements to human health is weak. We propose that a concerted effort to generate new empirical evidence on the health implications of these domains of food sovereignty is urgently needed, and suggest areas of research that may be crucial for addressing the gaps in the evidence base."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,ok,yes,no

Cash transfers, as part of safety net approach, have potential to prevent under-nutrition. However,  most of the cash transfer programs implemented and scientifically evaluated do not have a clear nutritional objective, which leads to a lack of evidence regarding their nutritional benefits. METHODS/DESIGN: The MAM'Out research project aims at evaluating a seasonal and multiannual cash transfer program to prevent acute malnutrition in children under 36 months, in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the Tapoa province (Eastern region of Burkina Faso, Africa). The program is targeted to economically vulnerable households with children less than 1 year old at the time of inclusion. Cash is distributed to mothers and the transfers are unconditional, leading to beneficiaries' self-determination on the use of cash. The study is designed as a two-arm cluster randomized intervention trial, based on the randomization of rural villages. One  group receives cash transfers via mobile phones and one is a control group. The main outcomes are the cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition and the cost-effectiveness. Child anthropometry (height, weight and MUAC) is followed, as well as indicators related to dietary diversity, food security, health center utilization, families' expenses, women empowerment and morbidities. 24 h-food recalls are also carried out. Individual interviews and focus group discussions allow collecting qualitative data. Finally, based on a theory framework built a priori, the pathways used by the cash to have an effect on the prevention of under-nutrition will be assessed. DISCUSSION: The design chosen will lead to a robust assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed intervention. Several challenges appeared while implementing the study and discrepancies with the research protocol, mainly due to unforeseen events, can be highlighted, such as delay in project implementation, switch to e-data collection and implementation of a supervision process.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agricultural industrialization and globalization are often identified as key processes in the erosion of food security and sovereignty. Global seafood production is dominated by modern day hunter-gatherers and so food sovereignty debates until recently have been confined to terrestrial systems. The recent introduction and subsequent spectacular proliferation of industrial marine aquaculture has brought the food sovereignty debate to the sea. The current hub of North American marine-based industrial aquaculture is British Columbia (BC) where salmon farming has grown to become a major factor in shaping coastal communities. Since its introduction into BC in the mid-1980s, the global industrial salmon farming industry has changed dramatically. The meteoric rise of farm salmon production exported from Norway, Chile, and Scotland has caused global salmon prices to plummet, forcing intense industry-wide rationalization. This is typically characterized by large multinationals cannibalizing smaller producers in order to establish economies of scale to counterbalance market price erosion of their product. As a result, global market forces have all but eliminated the sovereignty of both BC salmon farmers and salmon fishermen. Salmon farmers and fishermen-and their communities-must adopt ever-greater economies of scale to remain competitive with growing/consolidating foreign farm producers. All ecological issues associated with farms (organic wastes, parasites, toxins use, escapes etc.) are density dependant and therefore escalation of production results in incrementally greater ecological impacts. Further, the (d-)evolution of salmon from a culturally iconic seasonal delicacy and cultural keystone species of indigenous communities to a low-value global commodity has manifested a broad array of impacts highlighting the codependence of ecology, culture, and economics in coastal communities. Finally, increasing production increases supply, which in turn lowers price and alters consumer expectations of price/value relationships. This not only forces another round of production increases/consolidation on the farm, but also drives out commercial fishermen, particularly smaller owner/operators, who have no capacity to adopt economies of scale in the face of falling salmon prices. The ensuing rationalization process results in corporate fleets, the only model capable of adapting to the economic realities of the commoditization of salmon. Such loss of sovereignty effectively liquidates social capital of coastal communities which is instead invested into corporate machinery paying a lower rate of return far removed from the communities who are now left to pay off the interest as a legacy to the venture.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nicholas""=>false, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5.

Due to climate change and extreme whether conditions in recent years we have been facing a critical shortage in crop production that together with an increased demand for food has resulted in the increased price of food. The need for cost reductions, increased need for food and access to food in stores have also caused important changes in the food production sector. The mitigation and adaptation to climate change is crucial. The local production of food is the appropriate system for implementing sustainability and food security and can reduce the lack of food and insecurity in a crisis situation. In general, the problems of food can not be solved without taking ethics into account. The ethical principles are the most easily introduced in the local production of food."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

Preliminary findings indicate concern for food sovereignty, evidence of biocultural impacts of climate change, an increasing burden on women, debilitating opium addiction, the ecological importance of sacred sites, and other priorities related to sustainable livelihoods, such as energy needs (for fuel and lighting) and physical and social infrastructure in the form of roads and schools. In the complex setting of the Pamir Mountains, characterized by both cultural and ecological diversity and marked by artificial political boundaries, the creative and pragmatic interaction between indigenous and scientific knowledge sustains the best hope for survival. Applied research must combine communities of inquirers (research institutions) with communities of social practitioners (farmers, pastoralists, and civil society institutions) to facilitate indigenous participation in generating context-specific knowledge. The goal of such research is practical outcomes that will meet the urgent priorities of village communities.

The survey sought to identify with farmers their critical agronomic needs and production constraints in order to develop appropriate breeding strategies, as well as cowpea varietal preference for improved processing technology development. A rural participatory and conventional survey approaches were used. Close to half of the interviewed farmers cultivate both improved and local varieties. It was realized that 33 and 22% cultivated only local and improved varieties respectively. Generally, farmers indicated preference for improved varieties due to market value but rather preferred local varieties for household consumption and food sovereignty purposes. The top three most preferred varietal traits mentioned by farmers for breeding considerations included yield, tolerance to diseases and pests and seed colour. Processors preferred white seed coat varieties due to their good whipping ability and short cooking period. Farmers stressed the role of local varieties in food sovereignty with the early maturing ones being the most significant in household food provision."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Barbara""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

Via their self-sufficient agricultural practices, they cultivate the crop genetic diversity that enables food crops to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In this paper I draw upon empirical data from the Guatemalan center of agricultural biodiversity to investigate the concern that market expansion will displace peasant agriculture and undermine a cornerstone of the global food supply. I find that even though peasants' livelihoods involve multiple forms of market provisioning, they also engage in a Polanyian 'double movement' to protect their subsistence-oriented agricultural practices from the potentially deleterious effects of markets. I also investigate the so-called 'agrarian question' about the effects of market expansion on the viability of peasant agriculture, finding that although new forms of market provisioning are likely exacerbating rural inequality, the income from market activities actually enables rural Guatemalans to reproduce the conditions for peasant agriculture. Ultimately, I observe that the conservation of agricultural biodiversity and, consequently, global food security are contingent upon the 'food sovereignty' of peasant farmers.","PII 917020061     48

The process included a global encounter with the landless peoples in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the La Via Campesina conferences, and the global fora in Valencia and Porto Alegre. La Via Campesina has been developing a new concept of agrarian reform that recognizes the socio-environmental aspects of land, the sea and natural resources, in the context of food sovereignty. Integral agrarian reform encompasses policies of redistribution, just, equitable access and control of natural, social and productive resources (credit, appropriate technologies, health, education, social security etc.) by peasants and their families, indigenous people, landless workers, artisanal fisherfolk, pastoralists, the unemployed, Dalit communities, Afrodescendents and other rural peoples. It is argued that development policies should be based on agro-ecological strategies centred on family and peasant agriculture and artisanal fishing; trade policies that oppose dumping of products in the market and favour peasant and family farm production oriented towards local, national and international markets; and public policies in the areas of education, health and infrastructure for the countryside that complement trade and other policies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

In the Standing Rock Nation of the northern Great Plains, efforts to reclaim food sovereignty include projects to increase the availability of gathered and gardened plants that are necessary components of traditional foods. Toward this objective, a voucher based food assistance program administered by the Standing Rock Tribe is helping elders obtain culturally meaningful foods while contributing to the growth of farmers' markets within the reservation. As program enrollment and market attendance increase, organizers are considering the spatial arrangement of food system components and its influence on accessibility and participation. Our GIS spatial analysis of voucher issuance and redemption patterns reveals that the minimum cost-distance to market explains 33% of variance in voucher redemption. In order to improve program equity and efficiency, cost-distance models are used to identify potential additional market locations that would reduce the effort associated with trips to market and thus encourage participation.

Cuban peasants have been able to boost food production without scarce and expensive imported agricultural chemicals by first substituting more ecological inputs for the no longer available imports, and then by making a transition to more agroecologically integrated and diverse farming systems. This was possible not so much because appropriate alternatives were made available, but rather because of the Campesino-a-Campesino (CAC) social process methodology that the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) used to build a grassroots agroecology movement. This paper was produced in a 'self-study' process spearheaded by ANAP and La Via Campesina, the international agrarian movement of which ANAP is a member. In it we document and analyze the history of the Campesino-to-Campesino Agroecology Movement (MACAC), and the significantly increased contribution of peasants to national food production in Cuba that was brought about, at least in part, due to this movement. Our key findings are (i) the spread of agroecology was rapid and successful largely due to the social process methodology and social movement dynamics, (ii) farming practices evolved over time and contributed to significantly increased relative and absolute production by the peasant sector, and (iii) those practices resulted in additional benefits including resilience to climate change."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

For this purpose, a cross sectional study was conducted with family farmers in the state of Tocantins, in a transition area between the Savannah and the Amazon rain forest. Ranges of socio-economic indicators were collected among smallholders who cultivate Jatropha curcas and Ricinus communis. The preliminary results point towards a negative relationship between oilseed activity and local food production, harming the local food security. In addition, the farm income generated by the oilseed activity is lower than conventional crops, such as maize and cassava, for instance.

A series of severe weather-related events in 2009 damaged the economy, costing more than twice the national budget for agriculture that year. In 2010, rice imports reached an all-time high, making the Philippines the biggest rice importing country in the world that year. There are 94 million Filipinos today - 4 million more than in 2008. The population is expected to continue to grow by about 2 million a year. The domestic food chain (from farm to table) is under great pressure, corroded by years of neglect. Changes in the use of agricultural land, the degradation of ecosystems and the impacts of climate change are increasing the food production burden on agricultural communities in the Philippines. These challenges have together made the Philippines more vulnerable to global food price volatility. This report examines the issues confounding the Philippine food system and sets out recommendations for a new agricultural future in which Filipinos have enough to eat, always. Key recommendations include: public and private spending on smallholder agriculture must increase to levels that can unleash the productive potential of farming and coastal communities; public spending and policy innovations must be put in place to ensure that climate change adaptation programs are crafted early and implemented for, with, and by vulnerable communities; social protection programmes must be developed to strengthen the role of women in villages and the market; and the conversion of productive agricultural lands for purposes other than food production should cease."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

Food Sovereignty, a food system model spearheaded by La Via Campesina and other rural social movements around the globe, represents a unique opportunity to address the vulnerability of national food systems. Thanks to its mass organizations and popular participation in national policy, Cuba is one of the few countries with the capacity to implement food sovereignty, which could help it minimize the threats posed by food price fluctuation, extreme climatic events - the island experienced three catastrophic hurricanes in 2008 alone - and the persistent U.S. hostility towards its national project. The advance of food sovereignty in Cuba, as elsewhere, requires a profound commitment to the principles of agroecology, a heightened appreciation for smallholder farmer participation in increasing food production, and the possibility to design, manage and implement such a model at the national level. Guided by the principles of agroecology, and with the express aim of advancing the struggle for food sovereignty, researchers at the Universidad Central de Las Villas (UCLV) in Villa Clara province, Cuba are developing indicators of food sovereignty for practical use at the smallholder farm level."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

This region faces numerous social and physical challenges simply by nature of the size of the islands, and their geographical isolation.

The response to the increasing food prices has been to strengthen local food production. Increasing local food production and promoting local food consumption provides an excellent opportunity to address the nutrition-related health problems. However, local food production has to be sustained in the light of climate change.

""Canasta"" means ""basket"", and represents the basic food share that all citizens should have the right to access. The most impressive aspect of this movement is its grassroots-based origin: a movement born from necessity. In a country where national and local governments consistently fail to deliver food security measures, the canastas comunitarias provide a social safety net for marginalised populations. Essentially, the canastas comunitarias are urban consumer groups formed by neighbourhood ties or linked through churches, clubs or universities. Members of a canasta comunitaria can gain access to healthier food at lower costs through their community organizations. Ecuador is the seventeenth most biodiverse country in the world, home to over 80 native potato varieties. Despite this, the diet of the local population is based on rice, one potato variety ('Superchola'), wheat, corn, and is supplemented with processed foods. Through wholesale buying, the canasta comunitaria affords poor urban families with more nutritious options. As the canastas comunitarias increasingly save on their food purchases, consumers are beginning to wonder where their food comes from. Through farm visits, group members learn about the realities of agroecological farming. As the canastas comunitarias gain momentum, diverse projects have been proposed for building local economies around environmentally sound production. A priority of this movement is to increase consumer awareness about the origin of food in order to create a mutually beneficial farm-to-city market system. Consumer-based proposals include nutrition workshops and cooking classes, farm visits and exchange programmes, and educational fairs. Equally, small-scale producers must identify strategies for organised production and commercialization in order to meet new demands, in both quantity of production and quality.

In the food systems of South Asia, the margin between cultivated and uncultivated biodiversity dissolves through women's day-to-day practice of collecting and cooking food, constituting a feminine landscape. The authors bring this practice to light, and demonstrate the value of food production and consumption systems that are localized rather than globalized. Based on extensive field research in India and Bangladesh, with and by farming communities, the book offers both people-based and evidence-based perspectives on the value of ecological farming, the survival strategies of the very poor, and the ongoing contribution of biodiversity to livelihoods. It also introduces new concepts such as ""the social landscape"" and ""the ethical relations underlying production systems"" relevant to key debates concerning the cultural politics of food sovereignty, land tenure, and the economics of food systems. Photographs of plants, crops and people, especially of women and children, showing their relationships with their environs, the seeds they preserve, the foods they gather and cook, and the recipes they exchange, are included. This book is recommended not only to those interested in food policy and food security or in agricultural systems and local knowledge systems, but also to those who are simply curious about other communities and food variety. The authors are leading activists and accomplished researchers with a long history of engagement with farming communities and the peasant world in South Asia and elsewhere. The book includes a DVD entitled ""Diversity and Food Sovereignty"" - a collection of three farmer-made films. Their message is loud and clear: food sovereignty means the conservation of biological diversity and revitalization of ethical community relations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcela""=>true, ""jblesh""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

However, the yields and safety of local foods are sometimes poor in regions with severe pollution, particularly in household food production from contaminated landscapes in and near urban and industrialized areas. Urban food sustainability ultimately must reflect a local determination of food needs, which, among other things, reflects experience with local complications of environmental health. In such cases, the goal of local food security may incorporate non-local strategies. The case study from Gliwice in the Upper Silesia region of southwest Poland discusses (1) organizing an acquisition, labelling, and distribution system for retailing chemically tested organic products, linking farmers to consumers; (2) distributing chemically tested produce directly to schools and hospitals and creating subsidies for their purchase; and (3) educating community groups about food contamination and the benefits of organic foods and farming."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

Before 1994, the Food Control Law (1942) had regulated the production and distribution of rice. Its main purpose was to ensure stability in the supply, demand, and price of rice. Two major events in 1993, namely, acceptance of the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and the unprecedented poor rice harvest, led to a review of the rice control system. A report prepared in 1994 by the Agricultural Policy Council offered the following recommendations: (1) the government should continue rice production control by encouraging the voluntary participation of farmers' organizations; (2) a rice reserve system should be incorporated into a new rice management system; (3) the imported rice under the minimum access provision should be dealt with by the Food Agency; (4) voluntarily marketed rice should be the major emphasis on distribution; and (5) rice producers should be given more diversified opportunities to sell their products. The new law implemented these recommendations. It is concluded that although the rice reserve system was set up to be prepared for rice shortage, the measures for dealing with bumper harvests are not not sufficient.

The article describes regional settlement types, human ecological zones, and occupations, using data from a 1981 survey of 164 households in Beni, Bolivia. Among the survey sample, 99 households were urban, 41 were campesinos and 24 were from estates. Tapping wild rubber trees was the major economic activity. Data are used to demonstrate the contention that stimulating local food production is a necessary part of the general agricultural development of the area. Major topics given consideration are food insecurity, social stratification and the tension between household strategies and the exigencies of subsistence. Food insecurity contributes to indebtedness, residential mobility, and social inequalities.

Agriculture accounts for over 50% of GDP and employs about 70% of the labour force. Subsistence agriculture is traditional in Samoa with families farming plots of communally owned land. Cash cropping has become increasingly important however, and subsistence farming alone is now non-existent. Three major agricultural products, coconuts, cocoa and taro are cultivated. Copra products and cocoa bean, accounting for 40% of all exports, are the main exports. Production of taro has been steadily increasing. Coffee, groundnuts, bananas, pineapples and other tropical fruits are grown mainly for domestic consumption. The government is now anxious to diversify agricultural production away from copra and cocoa to include bananas, taro, other crops and animal feed products. Pigs and poultry are the main livestock, and cattle raising is being developed. A strain is being placed on Samoa's food supplies by the growing population compounded by a decline in the productive work force, due to emigration.

Food and nutrition security should be the framework for both national development policies of recipient countries and supporting activities of the donors. In ideal circumstances the developing countries should establish their own food and nutrition security strategies, covering food production, marketing/distribution, final consumption and, if feasible, the establishment of a strategic grain reserve. From most recent research it is evident that the effects of food aid on local food production depend more on the individual market and price policy of the recipient country, on their distribution system and on their use of any counterpart funds, than on pure market effects. The marketing and distribution system also influences whether needy target groups can be reached.

While these events centred on the major grain trading nations, they exposed serious weaknesses in the food situation of developing countries. The establishment of orderly national and, if possible, international grain stock policies has been widely accepted as one major action measure deserving attention. FAO's International Undertaking on World Food Security, adhered to by 50 countries, contains specific guidelines for such stock policies. Current food stock policies in developing countries are generally very weak. Although sizeable food stocks are already influenced by government agencies, such stocks do not usually make up a critical proportion of total food supply and, in effect, form at most a safety margin to cover unforeseen current requirements. On the basis of the first seven FAO surveys of national food security policies and action plans, it is tentatively concluded that progress could best be achieved if developing countries would establish specific programmes for stock building, covering a medium term period. Priority action will not only concern stocks but will first of all require more adequate domestic food information systems and the establishment of preparedness plans to cover any food emergencies. Actual stock targets could be moderate, provided private food stocks are monitored and central control is exercised on grain imports and exports.

One is the African Green Revolution model, implemented by a consortium of partners comprised of African governments, the private sector, philanthropic donors, and multilateral institutions.

On one hand, the African Green Revolution favors modern rationalist notions of economic structural transformation and agricultural development. On the other hand, food sovereignty is inspired by historical structural ideas rooted in sociology that tackle issues of power and (in) justice embedded within global political and economic institutions. These diametrically opposed ideological foundations help to explain the polarization and tensions that exist between the two agrarian models.

The article questions the impacts of these trends from two main perspectives: their effect on the power relations between actors; and their transformative potential, that is their capacity to alter a sectorial frame of reference driven by market and multi-functionality logics. The demonstration relies on a case study located in Geneva, Switzerland, concerned with the development of the regional brand Geneve Region - Terre Avenir (GRTA). This case is interesting for three reasons: the close (and explicit) link to urban agriculture and food sovereignty, the collaborative forms of governance that have been developed in a country where the agro-food sector has long been considered as strongly corporatist, and the criteria of guarantee (quality, proximity, traceability and fairness) that distinguish GRTA from comparable brands. These singularities are explored through a cognitive approach, which considers change as the result of a confrontation between communities of actors whose belief systems diverge. Throughout the case study, compromises and imbalances between communities are highlighted. In the end, the difficulties to upset the dominant frame of reference are underlined."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

If successful, the model would also produce benefits around biodiversity conservation, environmental sustainability and diverse diets in this part of Kenya where high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity persist despite the abundance of local nutritious biodiversity. Two years down the line, the ACIAR project has successfully developed a holistic pilot to connect production and consumption of local edible biodiversity and established an enabling environment in the county for a workable food procurement model that puts local food diversity at its core and which can potentially be rolled out in other locations. First steps included the development of an adapted Farmer Business School (FBS) model, which includes elements of group strengthening, local food production, nutrition education, business management and marketing. Secondly, training was provided to 547 men and women farmers from Busia's seven sub-counties who are now better equipped to penetrate local markets, apply and win tenders from public institutions and compete with other suppliers. All along, nutrition education and awareness activities were carried out to increase awareness and demand for local nutritious crops. Since the pilot was launched in one school in mid-2016 catering for 410 students, the farm-to-school network is now providing healthy school meals to approximately 5,500 pupils. The linking of farmer groups to schools and health clinics has created employment opportunities for the farmers who now have a steady market for their produce while schools see the relationship of linking to local farmers as part of their social corporate responsibility and assured safe vegetable supply. Furthermore, the pilot study, along with the Biodiversity for Food and Nutrition (BFN) project, helped facilitate the development of the first biodiversity policy for Busia County and for the rest of Kenya. The policy, still awaiting approval, provides a framework for the effective conservation and use of biodiversity and proposes that at least 30% of food procured by schools and hospitals must be locally-sourced and coming from family farmers. Project achievements are also feeding into the development of a County Nutrition Action Plan (CNAP) aimed at providing a framework for coordinated high impact nutrition interventions by county government and nutrition stakeholders."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

This is particularly due to the transparency and traceability characteristic of a short supply chain and social aspects related to food origins. The trend has been increasingly common during the past decade in Europe and North America, and it is strongly evident in the case area of this study in Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. In general, ease of access to food is highly important for consumers and crucial for institutional kitchens, in addition to quality aspects and price. However, regardless of proximity, poor accessibility is one of the key issues preventing the further growth of local food markets. Due to scale economics in food value chain, food transport is presently organised mainly by centralised, large-scale logistics companies directed via hubs serving millions of consumers. Accordingly, production volumes required to enter large-scale markets are often unattainable for disjointed small-scale local food producers. In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based accessibility analyses are applied for analysing potential for integral networking of local food production and transport companies. Berry production was selected as a case study because it has a relatively strong role in Northern Ostrobothnia, while its logistics are notably underdeveloped. Spatial data of primary production volumes consists of register records of farm-specific cultivation areas and average yields in Northern Ostrobothnia and Finland. Accessibility computations are based on the digital model of the Finnish road network, Digiroad. Two surveys were also implemented to farmers and food processing companies to seek views on food processing, sales, logistics and procurements regarding local food. Data from the surveys was used in accessibility analysis, which enables exploration of opportunities for establishing 'local food' clusters integrating small producers into a more effective and competitive network. Information about favourable conditions for cooperative networks in the local food sector may help in establishing companies and their growth. Again, successful networking may increase scale economies in local production in transport, processing and marketing."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

Method: Exploratory, descriptive study based on secondary data and key informant reports. A search of governmental and non-governmental initiatives was carried out at the autonomous community level. Government initiatives were located through school feeding programmes in the different autonomous communities, their nutritional guides and representatives of the councils for education and agriculture. Non-governmental initiatives were found through their own websites and the snowball technique. Initiatives were analysed by their geographic distribution, organizational area (government vs. non-government), number of school centres carrying out the initiatives, management style and organic food purchase. A descriptive analysis of the data was carried out. Results: 12 initiatives carried out by 318 schools (2.16% of all the schools with food service in Spain) were identified. Among these, 6 are governmental initiatives with a scope of 274 schools (1.86%), and 6 are non-governmental initiatives with a scope of 44 schools (0.30%). Most of these schools have a public management system in place (n=284). All the initiatives provide for the purchase of organic food. Conclusion: Local food purchase initiatives in Spain have a limited reach.

The theoretical concern of this paper is with issues of identity formation and continuity through the materiality of food and food systems, in the context of varying assumptions underlying discourses of development. The Suri people remain at the margins of the modernizing Ethiopian state and experienced a decline in food security, health and wealth in the last decade, coinciding with growing inter-group tension and new state developmental plans which devalue the agro-pastoral mode of life. State support or investment is in massive sugar and other mono-crop plantations and in enterprises by foreigners and private capitalists, not matched by parallel investment in local economies of agro-pastoralism and crop cultivation. Some of the effects on the production system, diet and 'food sovereignty' of the Suri are described so as to highlight the challenges they face, including growing internal differentiation, pressure on modifying their food system and the increasing sale and use of alcoholic drinks.

This approach emphasizes small-scale farmers as the main actors in a food and agricultural system. It encourages small-scale farmers to fully participate in the decision-making process of national and/or international agreements regarding food and agriculture systems in order to benefit and empower them. Food sovereignty aspires to return the food and agriculture system to a domestic level, which gives freedom to small-scale farmers to produce foods reflecting their knowledge and experience and suited to the local conditions. Agroecology is a management approach aimed at achieving a sustainable agricultural ecosystem utilizing local resources, local wisdom, and local farmers' knowledge in producing foods. Thus, agroecology minimizes production costs, increases the quality and quantity of foods, and gives small-scale farmers more benefits. According to knowledge-sharing, an educational theory for explaining farmer-to-farmer ways of learning, there are three requirements for an effective learning process: (1) a public space to share knowledge and experience; (2) provision of opportunities for every participant to share and exchange their knowledge, views, and experience; and (3) a need for farmers to enhance their competence. The agroecological approach has been practiced and disseminated within farmers' communities at the grassroots level and has shown promising results. Studies showed that by practicing agroecology farmers produced more foods and gained other benefits, suggesting that agroecology could be one answer for the food crisis. Farmers' knowledge and experience are vital to food and agriculture policy-making. Thus, by recognizing farmers' knowledge and understanding their learning processes, a fair participatory food and agricultural system can be achieved, an ideal that the food sovereignty approach strives for.

This book takes on some of the myths about how the local food system works and what it needs to thrive. Advocates claim that small biodiverse farms will fundamentally change farming, rural communities, and the American diet. For many, simply by knowing our farmers we become champions of a new way of eating that revolutionizes our economy and society. But that argument ignores the fact that if local food is to succeed, it requires many of the trappings of conventional food production, including processors, middlemen, inspectors, and regulators. By listening to and working alongside people trying to build a local food system in Iowa, the author uncovers the complex realities of making it work. Although the state is better known for its vast fields of conventionally grown corn and soybeans, it has long boasted a robust network of small, diverse farms, community supported agriculture (CSA) enterprises, and farmers' markets. The book asks how Iowa's small farmers and CSA owners deal with farmers' market regulations, neighbors who spray pesticides on crops or lawns, and sanitary regulations on meat processing and milk production. How can they meet the needs of large buyers like school districts? Who does the hard work of planting, weeding, harvesting, and processing? Is local food production benefitting rural communities as much as advocates claim? It is argued that we can make local food systems work, but we have to do more than shop at our local farmers' market to make it happen.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

Examining the elements of food security through the food system participation framework of food sovereignty is an opportunity worthy of further exploration. This paper seeks to add a dimension to the understanding of food security by considering the value that a food sovereignty perspective has on the right to access food that is nutritious and safe for consumption. Current themes are cited and reviewed, and the implications of both food security and food sovereignty perspectives for the food system are argued. Agricultural trade liberalisation has benefited some societies and harmed others. To this end, the Global Strategic Framework (the Framework) on Food Security and Nutrition has recently incorporated the philosophy of the food sovereignty movement into its guidelines.

A historical lens allows us to understand the social structures and institutions that condition the politics of food over time and the ways in which the agency of relevant state and societal actors has been, and continues to be, enhanced and exercised, or not, in the political contestation over the food system. A relational lens allows us to capture the process-oriented nature of food sovereignty - the ways in which the very meanings and attempted practices of food sovereignty are being dynamically and contentiously shaped and reshaped over time. An interactive lens allows us to analyze how actors within the state and in society are dialectically linked, molding the construction of food sovereignty through their interactions. Rather than an enquiry into food sovereignty per se, this piece is about efforts toward food sovereignty, partly to address a tendency in the literature and political debates to conflate the two. This is thus an investigation into food sovereignty construction, meaning how food sovereignty is being articulated and attempted, as well as contested - including resisted, refracted or reversed - in a given setting. The case of Venezuela is examined as one of a growing number of countries where food sovereignty has been adopted into state policy and among the longest-running experiments in its attempted construction.

Recycling of waste water and sewage is carried out and used to water urban landscaping and some crops, but there are risks of the presence of pathogens. Much food today is imported to satisfy the requirements of expanding populations, especially foreign workers on temporary visas who make up more than half the residents in many of these Gulf States. Despite limited published data on Gulf States regarding enteric and foodborne diseases and their prevention and control, profiles emerge that can describe the current situation and some future directions. Gastrointestinal diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, and amebic dysentery can be brought into these countries through workers returning from endemic regions, and also through refugees from conflict-torn neighboring countries. However, some diseases are endemic like brucellosis and fatal illnesses from the newly identified Middle East Respiratory Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) associated with camels. In the 1990s, coalition troops stationed during the Gulf War brought in external suppliers and caterers, but using local products like chickens with troops occasionally suffering from infections. The hot climate, particularly in summer, can allow rapid growth of pathogens in foods, especially where refrigeration is not available as in home-prepared lunches by workers and during transportation of foods across traffic-congested cities. One of the biggest concerns for Saudi Arabia is the health oversight of millions during the annual Hajj, and despite much care over restriction of infected pilgrims and care of food, occasional outbreaks have been reported. Government agencies are particularly concerned about restaurant food and try and follow up on complaints of customers but rarely are agents identified; those that have include Salmonella, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Implicated foods include ethnic products such as Turkish menu items and shawarma. Local culture may play a role in allowing growth of pathogens such as serving women after men at weddings. However, deaths that have been attributed to microbial sources may have been caused by illegal use of pesticides such as aluminum phosphide. Severe penalties have been applied to owners and staff implicated in outbreaks including fines, jail sentences and deportations, which are not typical of Western nations. However, some agencies have initiatives to help educate and train foreign workers in several languages. Foodborne disease surveillance systems are generally not adequate though some countries have initiated modernization of inspection approaches and laboratories. Consumer surveys show that residents have some knowledge of foodborne disease but this could be improved especially for women who do most of the shopping and food preparation in homes.

Each of the nine essays describes Hawai'i's foodscapes and collectively makes the case that food is a focal point for public policy making, social activism, and cultural mobilization. With its rich case studies, the volume aims to further debate on the agrofood system and extends the discussion of food problems in Hawai'i. Given the island geography, high dependency on imported food has often been portrayed as the primary challenge in Hawai'i, and the traditional response has been localized food production. The book argues, however, that aspects such as differentiated access, the history of colonization, and the neoliberalized nature of the economy also need to be considered for the right transformation of our food system. The essays point out the diversity of food challenges that Hawai'i faces. They include controversies over land use policies, a gendered and racialized farming population, benefits and costs of biotechnology, stratified access to nutritious foods, as well as ensuring the economic viability of farms. Defying the reductive approach that looks only at calories or tonnage of food produced and consumed as indicators of a sound food system, Food and Power in Hawai'i shows how food problems are necessarily layered with other sociocultural and economic problems, and uses food democracy as the guiding framework. By linking the debate on food explicitly to the issues of power and democracy, each contributor seeks to reframe a discourse, previously focused on increasing the volume of locally grown food or protecting farms, into the broader objectives of ecological sustainability and economic viability."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""tanyakerssen""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

We analyze here the possible effects of local crises by developing a new propagation model, parsimonious but grounded on data-based and statistically-verified assumptions, whose effectiveness is proved on the Argentinean crisis in 2008-09. The model serves as the basis to propose indicators of crisis impact and country vulnerability to external food-production crises, which highlight that countries with largest water resources have the highest impact on the international trade, and that not only water-scarce but also wealthy and globalized countries are among the most vulnerable to external crises.

To facilitate this, we link reflections and methodologies from complex system thinking and vulnerability studies applied to agri-food systems to propose an integrated framework of assessment, which links the agroecological context and the social function of agriculture, considering actor's agency and institutional processes. This framework is suitable to analyze agri-food systems in fragile and marginal environments such as the Andean region. We apply the framework to assess vulnerability of local agri-food systems to global change in the southern Ecuadorian Andes, taking into account the role of peasant institutions (agroecological associations, comunas) and indigenous culture.

In particular, trade liberalization has deepened patterns of food import dependence and the export orientation of peasant farming. But there are also powerful cultural dimensions to food import dependence that further problematize the challenge of pro-poor agrarian change. Food cultures are sometimes underappreciated in the food sovereignty literature, which tends to assume that there will be a preference for local or 'culturally appropriate' foods. In Haiti, historically ingrained and persistent ideologies of racism magnify class hierarchies and the common perceptions of peasants at the bottom of the social order. This paper explores the intersection of socially constructed ideologies of racism with peasant aspirations for socio-cultural mobility, drawing from 30 qualitative interviews with key informants in government, non-governmental organizations, and social movements, and 108 qualitative interviews and 216 food preference surveys that were conducted in three sites in rural Haiti between November 2010 and July 2013. The core argument is that racially-coded class hierarchies exert a powerful influence on dietary aspirations, as 'peasant' foods like millet, root crops and molasses bread are commonly denigrated by Haiti's poor, including peasants themselves, while 'elite' and 'foreign' foods like white flour bread, Corn Flakes, and spaghetti get held up as superior. This suggests a need to appreciate how the cultural geographies of food interact with - and can in fact exacerbate - political and economic inequalities, which raises challenging questions for peasant movements and advocates of food sovereignty."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

However, the implementation of the designed measures faced obstacles. Therefore, the research objective was to display how the government's measures aiming to support domestic food production influenced urban agriculture. The qualitative research comprised semi-structured interviews with 15 urban farmers in Havana and revealed the respondents' experiences with the land reform and the Lineamientos and the potential of the reforms to implement food sovereignty. Findings show that the land reform has facilitated access to land for newcomer and existing farmers. However, availability of agricultural inputs has been limited and they were often expensive. Thus, urban farmers frequently produced farm inputs at their plots and applied sustainable farming practices to minimize their dependence on external inputs. The reforms have generated private marketing opportunities and have stimulated urban farmers to increase production. At the same time, subsidies have been reduced and consumers have faced increasing food prices. In conclusion, the land reform and the Lineamientos have created framework conditions for food sovereignty.

This paper draws from the case of Haiti to challenge these assumptions, illustrating how food preferences do not always align with tradition, and that even the poorest members of society sometimes opt to pay more for prestigious foods in an attempt to improve their social standing. In Haiti, food hierarchies mirror persistent race and class based social stratifications in troubling ways, and food meanings bear significantly on food choice.

This framework is guided by the following overarching question: How can food systems education prepare individuals and teachers to transform the food system, and help communities attain food sovereignty? Following a review of the food systems education literature, we highlight the constraints of the depoliticized approach by drawing attention to its race and class-based assumptions. We then construct a definition of CFSE, and articulate the theoretical and practical cornerstones of this perspective, which are drawn from critical pedagogy, food justice, food sovereignty, and agroecology.

This paper analyses this ongoing process of agrarian development from the perspective of three major approaches: the food availability approach, the entitlement and livelihood approach, and food sovereignty. We draw on quantitative and qualitative data collected from 68 households in rural Tamil Nadu on landholding and management, farm diversity, agricultural production, food availability, off-farm employment, rural out-migration, objective and subjective wellbeing, and socioeconomic and demographic profile of respondents. Results: Rural households were classified in four categories, based on their engagement in agriculture and off-farm employment, to understand the interplay between food sufficiency and wellbeing. The households solely based on small-scale agriculture were found to have higher food sufficiency, landholding, and crop diversity, but lower monthly income and wellbeing. The households that were engaged in off-farm employment in addition to agriculture were found to have lower food sufficiency, landholding, and crop diversity, yet they exhibited better wellbeing and higher income. The landless households, which were primarily engaged in off-farm labour, work in distant markets had higher income than households solely engaged in farming. However, they had the lowest wellbeing index among all household types. The findings indicated that the impacts of women's participation in local or distant employment schemes on household food security and wellbeing were complex and shaped by the household's engagement in agriculture and their aspirations for a better quality of life. Conclusions: None of the three food security approaches provides a fully satisfactory basis for interventions aimed at enhancing the capacity of small and marginal farmers to achieve food security and meet their aspirations for wellbeing in the research area, although the entitlements and livelihoods approach has had a significant impact on local possibilities for livelihoods diversification. The study demonstrates that the interaction between food security and the subjective wellbeing of farmers is complex and shaped by the productivity of small-scale agriculture and livelihood aspirations of farm households."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""annelie.bernhart""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

It argues that in countries like Ecuador, food networks that do not establish an ontological difference between 'nature' and 'culture' promote food sovereignty in practice as long as agricultural and science and technology (S&T) policies enable the autonomous development of such networks. It shows that, in fact, the lupine (Lupino mutabilis) food networks in the Andean highlands have traditionally functioned in a rhizomatic way, without establishing hierarchies between entities, like foods as goods or foods as gifts, do not prioritize society over nature, and have, moreover, expanded without discontinuities between urban and rural areas. This analysis shows that these networks can promote food sovereignty, because in them is condensed an ontology that is distinct from that of modernity with regard to the cultivation, processing and consumption of food. Considering these findings, the rationality of S&T policies (specifically those related to plant breeding) and the current policies of the Ecuadorian State (including the recent translation of the Via Campesino food sovereignty proposal into the Ecuadorian Constitution) is analysed. It is argued that such policies go against the logic of food networks.

The ordinance exempts direct transactions of farm food from licensure and inspection in an effort to maintain the viability of small, diversified farms in a struggling rural economy. The ordinance effectively carves out a space of food sovereignty in each town that enacts it, thereby protecting conditions of life and livelihood within local food networks. The analysis focuses on the spatiality of the practices that comprise biopolitics, with attention to the scalar politics in play as well; that is, the ways in which modalities of power shape and are shaped by social, economic, and political scales of organization.

Another is the search for inclusive methods and language to discuss these operational, 'territorial' agendas with potential constituents. This paper argues that both questions call for an investment lens, a complementary approach within food sovereignty that proposes and discusses investments rather than political demands. Decolonial epistemology will treat existing investment lenses critically; however, in doing so it also urges new perspectives on what constitutes investment, the categories of cost involved, and the measurements employed. In following the rationale of investment in agro-ecological theory and practice, the paper next argues that the reconstruction of 'big push theory' outside the 'modernisation' paradigm that once produced it is possible, and that formulation and discussion of big push strategies could reclaim a space within critical agrarian studies. Big push theory offers a frame for the consistent critique of 'silver bullet' development projects through the study of negative feedback loops; and a frame for the study of positive feedback loops, which crucially underlie the proposals of food sovereignty movements for broad, integrated changes in agrarian systems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

One of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal is that most part of the food is traded through markets handling patterns that are hardly compatible with family farming. Perhaps the key to solving this problem lies in identifying the achievements and paths followed by the same producers that have developed alternative marketing strategies. Many family farmers have developed viable entrepreneurships, building innovative markets for their products based on short circuit commercialization systems that not only increase profitability due to a cut of intermediaries, but also lower the food prices and provides the final consumer with better quality products as a consequence of the added value strategy followed by the producers. In that context, this study exposes three cases of family farms located in the irrigation area of Rio Dulce, Province of Santiago del Estero (Argentina). The cases present a similar productive, economic and social logic, characterized by a strong co-production between man and nature, provided by a combination of endogenous resources, value added, generation of technological novelties and craftsmanship, among others, within a strong process of family labor intensification."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

Nonetheless, the food security contribution by the four sectoral policies involved is mutually constrained: our agriculture is protected by the world's highest tariffs.

Moreover, these inefficiencies also prevent trade and investment policies which would keep markets open, development policies which would provide African farmers with the tools to become more competitive, and supply policies which would work against speculators. The paralysing effect of Swiss agricultural policies is exacerbated by new ""food security subsidies"" in the name of ""food sovereignty"" while two pending people's initiatives might yet increase the splendid isolation which in effect reduce Swiss farmer competitiveness and global food security.

Much land in this deltaic zone that had previously been employed for various forms of peasant production has been transformed by the introduction of brackish-water shrimp aquaculture. This has, in turn, caused massive depeasantization and ecological crisis throughout the region. Through an examination of two markedly different polders (embanked islands) - one which has been overrun by shrimp production and one that has resisted it - we ask how coastal communities and their members have variously negotiated their rapidly changing ecologies and food systems based on their relative class position and access to land. We highlight the multiple meanings that peasants from different classes ascribe not just to shrimp, but also to broader questions of adaptation, community and life in uncertain terrains. We show that while food sovereignty in non-shrimp areas has averted the depeasantization affecting shrimp areas, it has not necessarily led to greater equality in agrarian class relations. To achieve such ends, we suggest that a broader conception of agrarian sovereignty provides a critical and necessary corollary to self-determination in agricultural production."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

However, the co-existence of chronic hunger and malnutrition with presence of adequate capacities to address it is one of the gravest paradoxes of our time. In one-third of African countries the average daily calorie intake remains below the recommended level of 2100 kcal. The need and importance for greater food sovereignty has emerged out of broader concerns over the negative impact of world's food system on food security and environmental sustainability. Adoption of the food sovereignty principles are essential to empower local communities to have greater control over their productive resources, use and sustain ecologically friendly means of production, and access local markets as well as nutritious and culturally accepted food. The majority of African farmers are smallholders. However, the existing trend of land grabbing in Africa seriously affects food sovereignty in an unprecedented level. Based on the secondary sources, this paper explores different dimensions of the complex relationship between food sovereignty and land grabbing in African countries. It also analyses the various aspects on how the ongoing process of land grabbing in Africa affects food sovereignty which in turn leads to food insecurity of millions. The introduction of intensive agricultural production, due to land grabbing often based on a transformation of complex farming systems for commercial purpose can seriously threaten biodiversity.

While the described phenomena have undoubtedly contributed to a widespread decline in soil productivity of the vast marginal agro-pastoral millet and sorghum based land use systems, a few, largely overlooked, innovations have allowed enhancing productivity across a range of agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions. These are worthwhile to analyse in order to better understand how the well-known constraints to farmers' investments in more sustainable agro-pastoral production systems can be overcome. Successful innovations such as the locally made 'charette', a donkey-drawn, single axe farm transport vehicle, and the counter-season cultivation and regional marketing of onion have transformed subsistence agriculture in Niger since the 1970s. More recently the use of small amounts of seed-placed mineral phosphorus fertilizer (propagated as 'microdosing' by NGOs, FAO and the Gates Foundation) in millet and sorghum, a sprawling use of urban and periurban land for the highly intensive production of vegetables, specialty crops and sometimes also milk, as well as the fattening of small ruminants for religious festivals provide opportunities to effectively strengthen poor people's livelihood strategies and enhance their food sovereignty, often without involvement of extension services. The factors which seem to determine the success of such approaches are (i) their capacity to enhance farmers' access to markets (secure sales and cash earning), (ii) the possibility to adopt an innovation with only small amounts of capital (low entrance fee), and (iii) limited risk of failure despite high rainfall variability (safe return on investment).

This article examines activities undertaken by a collaboration of researchers and local institutions to enhance food security within informal seed systems in Thai and Cambodian rural communities. We employed a two-step model for strengthening food security using a range of participatory activities to first understand and characterize, and secondly strengthen informal seed systems in the target regions. We documented seed pathways, histories, and storage as well as gender roles in each community.

In this scenario, countries around the world, especially developing countries where the pervasiveness of hunger and food scarcity is more acute, are resorting to various counter strategies to meet the growing demand and to avert food insecurity and famine. Over the recent years there has been growing interest to strengthen and intensify local food production in order to mitigate the adverse effect of global food shocks and food price volatilities. Consequently, there is much attention towards home gardens as a strategy to enhance household food security and nutrition. Home gardens are an integral part of local food systems and the agricultural landscape of developing countries all over the world and have endured the test of time. Through a rigorous literature review, this paper first examines definitions and characteristics of home gardens and then provides a global review of their social, economic, and environmental contributions to communities in various socio-economic contexts. Many of the compositions on home gardens share research and experiences of developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These studies recognize positive impacts of home gardens towards addressing food insecurity and malnutrition as well as providing additional benefits such as income and livelihood opportunities for resource-poor families and delivering a number of ecosystem services. However, only a handful of case studies were found on post-crisis settings. While providing a general overview of some of these studies, this review investigates the home garden experiences of post-conflict Sri Lanka, where home gardening has been practiced for centuries. While emphasizing multiple benefits, we also highlight constraints to home garden food production. In conclusion, we emphasize the need for more research and empirical data to appraise the role of home gardens in crisis and post-crisis situations, as well as assessing their economic value and their impacts on food security, nutrition, economic growth, and gender issues.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

However, Nepal is experiencing decline in food security situation due to collision of domestic, national and international crises viz. poor agricultural growth, declined national agricultural priority, global climate change, global food crisis, and political instability. There is domination of small and marginal holders in Nepalese agriculture. Although the share of agriculture in country's GDP is decreasing, it is still 33%, and the highest among the South Asian countries. Cereals are the most important staple food crops in Nepal and rice number one from area and production followed by maize, wheat, millets and barley. The grain-legumes and potatoes are considered the protective food crops for the maintenance of balance human nutrition in Nepal. Out of 88 countries, Nepal ranked 57th in Global Hunger Index (GHI) with GHI value of 19.8 depicting alarming situation of hunger in different regions of the country. Since the III Five year plan (1975-80), the government of Nepal has given high priority in agriculture, focusing major approaches on promotion of integrated farming systems to address food and nutrition security. However, the food security situation is deteriorating. Adaptive measures on climate change, food distribution policy, crop and livestock insurance, subsidies on fertilizers and seeds, research and development activities on food-grain crops and bio-diversity conservation, inter agency coordination, food and seed buffer stock, and institutional capacity building would the viable options to maintain the food security in Nepal. From the rigorous study of various past research works, it can be concluded that the wider gap of several food grain crops can be reduced by system research, crop modelling, and up-scaling the use of agricultural machineries and tools."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

Small farms are the most important constraint limiting food security; consequently, farmers seek their survival either in animal production or in employment outside agricultural sector, and the arable land is then considered only as the source for direct payment from Brussels. From the standpoint of possible hard time for national survival (the long term political instability, global economical crisis, or war), Slovenian high dependency on imported food is rather irresponsible. The article suggests ways to enhance the food sovereignty, in case of need, with the help of scenarios of Slovenian agriculture transformation. Projections envisages a significant reduction in of growing voluminous feed on the cropland; to reach higher part/portion of grain crops in the crop rotation; to return previous cropland, which has been during the last decades changed to grassland, back to cropland again; to promote arrondation/land consolidation of arable land and irrigation (when needed) of arable land. Such reconstruction of agricultural production is the basis for necessary changes in nutrition between Slovenian population: we have to move from existing food habits with too much fats and proteins to more healthy and more balanced food, domestically produced, calorific sufficient, with energetic proportion between proteins, fats and carbon hydrates 13: 25: 61.

In this paper we explore the concept of food sovereignty in relation to the current development of the European food systems with special emphasis on social food networks, and agricultural learning network building. Food sovereignty is often discussed in the Global South, e.g. Latin America, where the concept developed in strong popular movements. Which lessons can we learn from others, e.g. the so-called 'developing countries'? Danish and French cases will represent and contrast food system policies and social food and farmer networks in the North-Western European context. Based on this, we will discuss the special opportunities and challenges for reaching food sovereignty considering the current globalised world, challenged by financial and environmental crisis. Our agriculture has generally become increasingly industrialized and food systems increasingly controlled by major companies. This influences how feed and food is transported, stored, traded, consumed and wasted. Complex knowledge (including traditional) about agricultural systems and social relations in agriculture and food gets lost. The Common Agrarian Policies (CAP) influences the development of local alternatives farming systems and national food sovereignty. We will discuss the potential role and tendencies of alternative farming and food systems (e.g. organic, mixed farming with agro-ecological basis) based on cases where consumer-farmer networks increase common knowledge about food production, act and interact collectively for local social and political change by building food systems over which they as local communities can take ownership and control.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>false, ""Nicholas""=>true, ""mfeldman""=>true, ""Hannah""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5.

Remote northern First Nations communities suffer disproportionate rates of food insecurity and confront many social problems that stem from colonization. Access to healthy, inexpensive, and culturally appropriate foods will not solve all of these problems; however, healthy food is necessary for wider social change and healthy living. Despite widespread knowledge of the food crisis in remote northern communities, little attention has been given to the suggestions of community members themselves for addressing these problems. Using a decolonizing, Talking Circle method, this study provides a voice for community members in a northern community in Ontario to share their experiences on healthy eating and food security. This paper rejects traditional academic writing and embraces Indigenous story-telling as a narrative framework. The outcome of the Talking Circles held with community members shows that there is a serious need for food security and food sovereignty (i.e., independence) in northern communities. Community members are ready and willing to think of solutions to the twin crises of food insecurity and ill health. The suggested solutions (a) require political sovereignty prior to sustainable social and economic development, and (b) emphasize the importance of traditional knowledge and values."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""mfeldman""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

In this article, we present an exploratory case that presents findings from research looking at the private emergency food system of a rural county in northern New England, U.S. Specifically, we examine the history of this national network to contextualize our findings and then discuss possibilities for collaboration between this private system and the local food movement (on behalf of both the public and the state). These collaborations present an opportunity in the short term to improve access to high quality local foods for insecure populations, and in the long term to challenge the systemic income and race-based inequalities that increasingly define the modern food system and are the result of prioritizing market-based reforms that re-create inequality at the local and regional levels. We propose alternatives to these approaches that emphasize the ability to ensure adequate food access for vulnerable populations, as well as the right to define, structure, and control how food is produced beyond food consumerism (i.e., voting with our dollars), but through efforts increasingly aligned with a food sovereignty agenda.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>false, ""jblesh""=>true, ""Barbara""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5.

The major impacts on agriculture from climate change are due to the pattern of rainfall and increased temperature. The increased temperature, in the longer term, has negative impact on crop yield through increased rate of respiration and evapo-transpiration process causing moisture deficit in the soil and plant system due to more emission of green house gases. Under changing precipitation trends, water harvesting is crucial to facilitate water availability. An integration of agriculture with forest, agro-forestry, can be effective to mobilize local capacities in relation to climate regulation. It is indeed necessary to formulate an integrated action plan for agricultural development in which adaptation strategies are embedded within the local spatial planning in consideration of economic, social and political context. The best adaptation measure to secure against climate change is to promote the principles and practices of sustainable agricultural technology among all farmers from marginalized to capitalized ones. More importantly, the promotional technologies of sustainable soil management, ecological practices of pest management, and participatory promotion of local varieties or landraces are the major adaptive mechanism to revive our agriculture from the impacts of climate change. Such practices are helpful to promote the concept of food sovereignty, which is utterly important in the developing countries like Nepal, rather than food security."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>true}",>true,2,>false,0,in,old,no,no

This has spawned a new research agenda under the moniker of ""food justice."" In this article, we contend that food justice research can benefit from employing the ""environmental inequality formation"" approach outlined by Pellow, which argues that environmental inequalities are the product of historical processes which involve multiple stakeholders with varied motives. Most importantly for this article, however, is his contention that these inequalities need to be addressed via a life cycle approach. We take this directive literally, and employ a cradle to the grave approach to food justice, or what we call the food cycle. This approach highlights how food inequalities occur in different ways and rates at different stages in the human life cycle. Here we focus on the very beginning of the food cycle by exploring breastfeeding and the food consumed by our most vulnerable population, infants. The case of breastfeeding helps to expand our understanding of food justice by unpacking some of the structural impediments that play a role in the disproportionately low rates of breastfeeding among women of color and the working classes. We conclude that elucidating food inequalities as they pertain to race, class, gender, and age will only increase the vitality of the field and can catalyze necessary changes to ensure food justice for all populations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true, ""annelie.bernhart""=>false, ""Barbara""=>true}",>true,2,>false,1,in,old,no,no

This trend has been reflected in the development of a variety of alternative food networks and short food supply chain initiatives. In Czechia, the local and good-quality movement has been significantly represented by the boom in farmers' markets during the past 2 years. The aim of this paper is to examine the actual potential of the Czech agricultural sector to supply the recently developed network of farmers' markets. Even though these markets are generally considered to offer farmers better revenues than selling their products to big processors and retail companies, many Czech farmers' market managers face a lack of potential vendors for their markets. Therefore, we ask if there are producers and self-processors of goods typically sold on farmers' markets of the appropriate size and legal form in suitable locations in relation to the areas of the biggest demand. The quantitative approach applied was based on the national statistical data on the agricultural sector. It was used to develop a set of indicators which have been displayed in maps and further examined. The results show a high theoretical potential of the Czech agricultural sector to supply farmers' markets because there are relatively many small farmers producing products sellable on farmers' markets. In the Czech context, where the tradition of running independent businesses was interrupted by the country's communist past, the lack of experience with private entrepreneurship and marketing among farmers seems to be the main obstacle to broader involvement of farmers on farmers' markets.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

At the same time that food hubs further the development of local food supply chains and create market opportunities for farms, they can also run contrary to the bigger and longer-term goals of the local food movement. In this viewpoint article, we look critically at the role of nonprofit food hubs in efforts to build local food systems. Speaking from our experiences in the local food movement in western North Carolina and drawing from social movements and food systems scholarship, we argue that food hubs, when used as primary mechanisms of local food system building, can deprive the movement of its capacity to activate broad participation in the food system. We argue that efforts to build local food systems need a foundation of work that engages people (such as farmers, citizens, people who work in the food industry) in processes that can shape the practices, values, and impacts of systems of food production and distribution. While they can mitigate the mismatch between the smaller scale typical of local food and larger mainstream markets, food hubs alone cannot challenge industry norms and practices, and they can even aid the food industry in maintaining the status quo.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

An increasing reliance on imported food products has not only affected the health of Pacific communities, but also threatened food security, as shown with the recent global food price crisis. Climate change further emphasizes the challenges to food security through its impact on food production, human health, infrastructure, national food sovereignty, and the ability of households to purchase food. To face these challenges, members of the Pacific Plant Genetic Resources Network (PAPGREN) met in 2009 to address the following constraints which specifically impact on the development of local agriculture: (1) lack of information/documentation on traditional crop species in the Pacific; (2) no regional priority list of traditional crop species; (3) lack of policy support from various government agencies; (4) poor awareness at all levels about the value and potential of underutilized species. A regional strategy on ""crops for the future"" in the Pacific based on underutilized plant species was developed containing the following key elements: 1. generation and collection of knowledge/ research; 2. communication and dissemination; 3. policy advocacy; 4. market development; 5. partnerships; 6. capacity building and institutional strengthening. The priority crops (currently underutilized) identified include breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), bananas of the Fe'i group and/or Pacific plantain, Polynesian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer), Pometia pinnata, giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma merkusii), bele (Abelmoschus manihot), the lesser aroids Alocasia and Xanthosoma and, particularly for the atoll islands, Pandanus spp. Priority research and development activities on these crops include increased regional exchange of information to determine gaps and identify areas of future research focus. Particular emphasis is placed on increasing capacity for plant breeding and the use of traditional knowledge for the conservation and utilization of these important crops.","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-10</p>

Western approaches to nutritional intervention must be made appropriate for the traditional food practices and food production techniques of the African peasant farmer. Major problems include shortage and inadequate distribution of food, food losses, low income, illiteracy, ignorance of food preservation, and disease. These problems are worsened by government pressures for cash crop production. Less than 50% of the rural population is served by health or nutrition programs aimed at improving nutritional status; existing programs have shown mixed success. More data is needed on local food production and food budgets. Agricultural planners need to define minimally adequate diets for the family and the community. Food policies, geared to the local farmer, should encourage diversification of the rural economy and agrarian reform. Nutritional interventions must allow for social, cultural, and regional beliefs, and educational efforts must work within local customs, politics, and needs. (nm)","<p>Last updated - 2018-02-09</p>

Taking a Right-to-Food approach, Zero Hunger Program combines direct support to     poor families, which is making good progress, with structural policies that, by their very nature, may take longer but are necessary to make hunger reduction sustainable by providing the poor with access to jobs and productive resources. We emphasised also that safety net programmes need to be supplemented by these structural reforms to protect the most vulnerable and enable them to participate in development.

This paper describes the path toward building a new governance framework for     the provision of public policies that initiated a virtuous cycle for the progressive     elimination of hunger and poverty. However, it is important to emphasize that     the country continues to be characterized by dynamics that generate inequalities     and threaten social and environmental justice.     2.The paper explains how Brazil has sought to find original solutions to eliminate     hunger and poverty, imposing on the State the obligation to implement public     policies that guarantee the fundamental rights of the human being: the right to     minimum income, food, health, education and work. The document is addressed     to people and organizations interested in learning about the strategies that the     country has been adopting to ensure food and nutrition security and sovereignty     as well as the human right to adequate food.     3. The country’s redemocratization process, which started in the mid-1980s, was     instrumental in forging the current relations between the State and civil society.     The 1988 Constitution guaranteed social, civil and political rights that forced the     Brazilian State to recognize the need to reorganize its structure and governance     in order to fulfill its new obligations. Moreover, the 1988 Constitution ensured     new forms of participation in public policies through councils and social control     policies, while enabling partnerships between the public sector and the nonprofit     private sector. A new arena for social dialogue has been established.     | 7 |     4. It was evident that the necessary changes to public institutions transcended     the boundaries of administrative and financial reform, requiring a more     comprehensive reformulation and expanding of the concepts of the various     government sectors and their corresponding action. Civil society has always been     present and played a leading role in this process of reconstruction and expansion     of public institutions, with a view to ensuring the newly achieved rights.     5.The systemic approach was the option of various sectors, possibly because it     facilitates the regulation of inter-federative coordination - federal, state and     municipal - and inter-sectoral management, where the roles and responsibilities     of each can be clearly defined and the autonomy of each federative entity     preserved. The adoption of a “national system” for the provision of public policies     was also in tune with the national trend of understanding the various sectors of     society in an inter-dependent and indivisible way. For Brazilians the concept of     food and nutrition security, in its broadest sense, is the result of the realization     of the right to food (regular and permanent access to adequate food for all) in     the conditions under which food is produced and sold, without compromising     other rights such as housing, health, education, income, environment, labor,     transportation, employment, leisure, freedom, and land access and tenure.     6.The Zero Hunger Project was originally conceived in 2001 by a nonprofit civil     society organization interested in contributing to the formulation of a National     Food and Nutrition Security policy that was still lacking in the country. The project,     which was adopted by Lula´s administration in 2003, defined the fight against     hunger and poverty as a political priority and paved the way for the development     of legal instruments that would ensure the continuity of policies and programs     targeted at the poor. In 2006, the Organic Law on Food Security (LOSAN) created     the National Food and Nutrition Security System (SISAN), with the aim to     guarantee and protect the human right to adequate food. It is important to note     that LOSAN has a strong human rights approach, placing human dignity and     empowerment at the core of discussions on public policy and strengthening     relations between governments and civil society. It also launched the basis for     the Constitution to include the right to food in the list of other social rights     which had already been secured, and which finally happened in 2010.     7. The mandate of the National Food and Nutrition Security System (SISAN) is to     organize and strengthen the institutions of the Brazilian State and create formal     spaces for social participation through Food and Nutrition Security Councils     (CONSEA) in designing, influencing and monitoring public policies in the field     | 8 |     of food and nutrition security and sovereignty. This paper presents the modus     operandi and inter-relations between the governance system forums and civil     society participation. It also presents the legal instruments that make up the     reference framework governing the human right to adequate food in Brazil.     8. Some of the key lessons learned from this historic process include: (i) the     importance of participatory pacts related to concepts and principles; (ii) the     appropriateness of the choice of a systemic and intersectoral approach as a     way to guarantee the human right to adequate food and promote food and     nutrition security; (iii) the relevant role of civil society ensured through formal     spaces of social dialogue (CONSEAs); (iv) the importance of the State putting     the protection of human rights above market interests; (v) the necessary practice     of intersectoral coordination in the design and management of public policies     on food and nutrition security; (vi) the strategic role of women in the struggle     to guarantee food sovereignty as well as the conservation and sustainable     management of natural resources; and (vii) the respect for and guarantee of     ethno-development principles in the design and implementation of public     policies for indigenous peoples, blacks, traditional peoples and communities.     9. Despite the undeniable progress made, many challenges still remain on the     Brazilian development agenda. The existing social inequality is incompatible     with the country’s current level of economic development. The number of     socially vulnerable people is still high, and they have no access to all the public     programs to which they are entitled. Moreover, there is a recurring effort from     conservative sectors to weaken and criminalize the social movements and     organizations fighting for social and environmental justice, which threatens to     undermine Brazilian democracy.     10. The paper concludes that the progress made by Brazil in the fight against     hunger and poverty resulted from the combination of the interests of     government and civil society through a process of collective, participatory and     democratic construction. The continuity of the main public policies that have     contributed to this progress and the convergence of political and social forces     are indispensable conditions to overcoming the challenges that still hinder the     elimination of all forms of social inequality and violation of rights."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no

En el estudio se planteó la hipótesis de que si un     agroecosistema familiar se maneja de forma agroecológica con el uso de las fuentes de     energías renovables (FER), se pueden lograr las tres soberanías estrechamente     relacionadas entre sí, la alimentaria, energética y tecnológica. El objetivo fue evaluar estos     niveles de soberanía en una finca familiar agroecológica, a partir de indicadores según Altieri     (2013). Los resultados muestran como el nivel de integración familiar, las prácticas     agroecológicas y la innovación campesina asociada a las tecnologías apropiadas y al uso de las FER pueden resultar en altos índices de las tres soberanías desde la agricultura familiar."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Devon""=>true}",>true,1,>false,0,in,old,no,no
