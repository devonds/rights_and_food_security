## Quantifying the impact of rights-based approaches to food security and nutrition

A systematic review comissioned by the the United Nations Committee on World Food Security High Level Panel of Experts working group on Agroecological approaches and other innovations for sustainable agriculture and food systems that enhance food security and nutrition, and the World Agroforestry Centre

## Abstract
This review assembles the evidence for rights-based approaches to food security and nutrition, ranging from policies of governments or other institutions to grassroots advocacy to interventions by NGOs. We systematically review the impacts of the right to food and food sovereignty for achieving food security and adequate nutrition. Commissioned by the United Nations Committee on World Food Security High Level Panel of Experts working group on "Agroecological approaches and other innovations for sustainable agriculture and food systems that enhance food security and nutrition," this review evaluates peer-reviewed and grey literature produced between 1992 and 2018. We find that there is strong evidence from across the globe that approaches based on food sovereignty and the right to food positively influence food security and nutrition outcomes. A smaller number of documented cases suggest that single rights-based policies or interventions were insufficient to overcome larger structural barriers to realizing food security or nutrition, such limited access to land or discrimination based on race, gender or caste.  Future work, both in research and in policy, should focus on how and under what circumstances rights-based approaches positively impact FSNâ€”or fail to do so.
